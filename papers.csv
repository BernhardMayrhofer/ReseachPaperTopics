Chong, Yun Li, Sofia Suvorova, Bill Moran","eess.SP","We investigate the challenging problem of integrating detection, signal processing, target tracking, and adaptive waveform scheduling with lookahead in urban terrain. We propose a closed-loop active sensing system to address this problem by exploiting three distinct levels of diversity: (1) spatial diversity through the use of coordinated multistatic radars; (2) waveform diversity by adaptively scheduling the transmitted waveform; and (3) motion model diversity by using a bank of parallel filters matched to different motion models. Specifically, at every radar scan, the waveform that yields the minimum trace of the one-step-ahead error covariance matrix is transmitted; the received signal goes through a matched-filter, and curve fitting is used to extract range and range-rate measurements that feed the LMIPDA-VSIMM algorithm for data association and filtering. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in an urban scenario contaminated by dense and uneven clutter, strong multipath, and limited line-of-sight."

The distinct differences as well as advantages of this scheme from traditional ones are as following. Firstly, optical pulses at a far-less-than-Nyquist rate are used to sample the broadband MW signal in a single channel. The optical pulse generation is only by modulating cascaded intensity and phase modulators with a single RF tone instead of any high-speed coding sequence modulation. Secondly, the spectral characteristics of the optical pulses are easy to be optimized in optical domain for different requirements without bandwidth limitations of electrical devices. The principle of this scheme is analyzed in theory and the performance is investigated in numerical simulation with a multi-band microwave signal with 20 GHz spectral range and SNR at 61 dB. The MW signal is reconstructed in a high fidelity with relative reconstruction error at 0.01 and SFDR at 99 dBHz2/3. The potentials for further performance optimization in practice are also dicussed."

In this paper we propose a new FBMC based communication system using two orthogonal polarizations for wireless communication systems: dual-polarization FBMC (DP-FBMC). Using this system we can significantly suppress the FBMC intrinsic interference. Therefore in DP-FBMC all the multicarrier techniques used in CP-OFDM systems for channel equalization, multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) processing, etc., should be applicable without using the complex processing methods required for conventional FBMC. DP-FBMC also has other interesting advantages over CP-OFDM and FBMC: it is more robust in dispersive channels, and also to receiver carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO). In our DP-FBMC system we propose three different structures based on different multiplexing techniques.

This combination strikes a good balance between high-capacity communications and parsimonious channel modeling, and also brings limited feedback schemes for downlink channel state information within reach---since such channel can be fully characterized by several key parameters. However, most existing channel estimation work under the DD model has not yet considered DP arrays, perhaps because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank tensor, and thus the key parameters of the channel can be effectively estimated via tensor decomposition algorithms.  On the theory side, we show that the DD-DP parameters are identifiable under very mild conditions, by leveraging identifiability of low-rank tensors. Furthermore, a compressed tensor decomposition algorithm is developed for alleviating the downlink training overhead. We show that, by using judiciously designed pilot structure, the channel parameters are still guaranteed to be identified via the compressed tensor decomposition formulation even when the size of the pilot sequence is much smaller than what is needed for conventional channel identification methods, such as linear least squares and matched filtering.  Numerical simulations are presented to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

Existing endpoint detection (EPD) methods mostly uses Short-Term Energy (STE), Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) based approaches and their variants. But STE and ZCR based EPD algorithms often fail in the presence of Non-speech Sound Artifacts (NSAs) produced by the speakers. Algorithms based on pattern recognition and classification techniques are also proposed but require labeled data for training. A new algorithm termed as Wavelet Convolution based Speech Endpoint Detection (WCSEPD) is proposed in this article to extract speech endpoints. WCSEPD decomposes the speech signal into high-frequency and low-frequency components using wavelet convolution and computes entropy based thresholds for the two frequency components. The low-frequency thresholds are used to extract voiced speech segments, whereas the high-frequency thresholds are used to extract the unvoiced speech segments by filtering out the NSAs. WCSEPD does not require any labeled data for training and can automatically extract speech segments. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm precisely extracts speech endpoints in the presence of NSAs."

This paper builds on the scope for usage of macroscopically semi-empirical models for degradation cost in economic dispatch problems and proves that these cost models derived from the existing semi-empirical capacity fade equations for LiFePO4 cells are convex under some operating condi-tions. The proposed non-linear model was tested on two data sets of varying size which portray different trends of seasonality. The results show that the model reflects the trends of seasonality existing in the data sets and it mini-mizes the total fuel cost globally when compared to conventional systems of economic dispatch. The results thus indicate that the model achieves a more accurate estimate of fuel cost in the system and can be effectively utilized for cost analysis in power system applications."

State-of-the-art methods approach the problem via low-rank matrix approximations to the matricized HSI and MSI. These methods are effective to some extent, but a number of challenges remain. First, HSIs and MSIs are naturally third-order tensors (data "cubes") and thus matricization is prone to loss of structural information--which could degrade performance. Second, it is unclear whether or not these low-rank matrix-based fusion strategies can guarantee identifiability or exact recovery of the SRI. However, identifiability plays a pivotal role in estimation problems and usually has a significant impact on performance in practice. Third, the majority of the existing methods assume that there are known (or easily estimated) degradation operators applied to the SRI to form the corresponding HSI and MSI--which is hardly the case in practice. In this work, we propose to tackle the super-resolution problem from a tensor perspective. Specifically, we utilize the multidimensional structure of the HSI and MSI to propose a coupled tensor factorization framework that can effectively overcome the aforementioned issues. The proposed approach guarantees the identifiability of the SRI under mild and realistic conditions. Furthermore, it works with little knowledge of the degradation operators, which is clearly an advantage over the existing methods.

It captures the signals that are transmitted through the vocal folds, along with the buzz tone of the larynx. Due to its skin contact, it is more robust to the environmental noise compared to the acoustic microphone that picks up the vibrations through air pressure, and hence the all interventions. The throat speech is partly intelligible, but gives unnatural and croaky sound. This thesis tries to recover missing frequency bands of the throat speech and investigates envelope and excitation mapping problem with joint analysis of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings. A new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral envelope mapping scheme, which performs the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the acoustic-microphone spectral envelope, has been proposed. In the source-filter decomposition framework, we observed that the spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings is an important source of the degradation in the throat-microphone voice quality. Thus, we also model spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals as a spectral tilt vector, and propose a new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral tilt mapping scheme to enhance throat excitation signal. Experimental evaluations are performed to compare the proposed mapping scheme using both objective and subjective evaluations. Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) and the wide-band perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics. Subjective evaluations are performed with A/B pair comparison listening test. Both objective and subjective evaluations yield that the proposed phone-dependent mapping consistently improves performances over the state-of-the-art GMM estimators."

The two challenge editions in 2015 and 2017 involved the assessment of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) in isolation from ASV using an equal error rate (EER) metric. While a strategic approach to assessment at the time, it has certain shortcomings. First, the CM EER is not necessarily a reliable predictor of performance when ASV and CMs are combined. Second, the EER operating point is ill-suited to user authentication applications, e.g. telephone banking, characterised by a high target user prior but a low spoofing attack prior. We aim to migrate from CM- to ASV-centric assessment with the aid of a new tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metric. It extends the conventional DCF used in ASV research to scenarios involving spoofing attacks. The t-DCF metric has 6 parameters: (i) false alarm and miss costs for both systems, and (ii) prior probabilities of target and spoof trials (with an implied third, nontarget prior). The study is intended to serve as a self-contained, tutorial-like presentation. We analyse with the t-DCF a selection of top-performing CM submissions to the 2015 and 2017 editions of ASVspoof, with a focus on the spoofing attack prior. Whereas there is little to choose between countermeasure systems for lower priors, system rankings derived with the EER and t-DCF show differences for higher priors. We observe some ranking changes.

Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of \emph{$28.77\%$}, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of $28.0\%$ by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network."
"arXiv:1804.09816","Alexander Cloninger, Stefan Steinerberger","eess.SP","We discuss the geometry of Laplacian eigenfunctions $-Δφ= λφ$ on compact manifolds $(M,g)$ and combinatorial graphs $G=(V,E)$. The 'dual' geometry of Laplacian eigenfunctions is well understood on $\mathbb{T}^d$ (identified with $\mathbb{Z}^d$) and $\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is self-dual). The dual geometry is of tremendous role in various fields of pure and applied mathematics. The purpose of our paper is to point out a notion of similarity between eigenfunctions that allows to reconstruct that geometry. Our measure of 'similarity' $ α(φ_λ, φ_μ)$ between eigenfunctions $φ_λ$ and $φ_μ$ is given by a global average of local correlations $$ α(φ_λ, φ_μ)^2 = \| φ_λ φ_μ \|_{L^2}^{-2}\int_{M}{ \left( \int_{M}{ p(t,x,y)( φ_λ(y) - φ_λ(x))( φ_μ(y) - φ_μ(x)) dy} \right)^2 dx},$$ where $p(t,x,y)$ is the classical heat kernel and $e^{-t λ} + e^{-t μ} = 1$. This notion recovers all classical notions of duality but is equally applicable to other (rough) geometries and graphs; many numerical examples in different continuous and discrete settings illustrate the result."

Using amplitude- and frequency-domain modeling techniques, it is shown that the estimator is inconsistent, biased and has a variance that may be underestimated if the simple model of quantization is applied. The effects of both sine wave offset values and additive Gaussian noise are taken into account. General estimator properties are derived, without making simplifying assumptions on the role of the quantization process, to allow assessment of measurement uncertainty, when this least-square procedure is used."

A mixed quality-of-service (QoS) problem is investigated in the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system where the minimum rate of non-real time users is maximized with per user power constraints whilst the rate of the real-time users (RTUs) meet their target rates. First an approximated uplink user rate is derived based on available channel statistics. Next, the original mixed QoS problem is formulated in terms of receiver filter coefficients and user power allocations which can iteratively be solved through two sub-problems, namely, receiver filter coefficient design and power allocation, which are dealt with using a generalized eigenvalue problem and geometric programming, respectively. Numerical results show that with the proposed scheme, while the rates of RTUs meet the QoS constraints, the $90\%$-likely throughput improves significantly, compared to a simple benchmark scheme."

This often results in overwhelming the clinical staff by numerous false or unurgent alarms and decreasing the quality of care through enhancing the probability of missing true alarms as well as causing delirium, stress, sleep deprivation and depressed immune systems for patients. One major cause of false alarms in clinical practice is that the collected signals from different devices are processed individually to trigger an alarm, while there exists a considerable chance that the signal collected from one device is corrupted by noise or motion artifacts. In this paper, we propose a low-computational complexity yet accurate game-theoretic feature selection method which is based on a genetic algorithm that identifies the most informative biomarkers across the signals collected from various monitoring devices and can considerably reduce the rate of false alarms."

The effectiveness of WaveNet vocoder to generate natural speech from the acoustic features has been proved in recent works. However, WaveNet vocoder sometimes generates very noisy speech suffering from the collapsed speech segments when only the limited amount of training data is available or significant acoustic mismatches exist between training and testing data. Such corpus limitation and limited model ability easily exist in some speech generation applications, such as voice conversion or speech enhancement. To address this issue, we propose a technique to automatically detect the collapsed speech segments.

Verification and subjective tests are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The verification results indicate that the detection technique can detect most collapsed segments. The subjective evaluations in voice conversion demonstrate the generation technique achieves significant speech quality improvement while keeping the same speaker similarity."

However, efficient exploitation of statistical dependencies measured by a mean squared error (MSE) does not always produce the best psychovisual result. One interesting approach is to only encode visually relevant information and use a different coding method for "perceptually insignificant" regions in the frame, which can lead to substantial data rate reductions while maintaining visual quality. In this paper, we introduce a texture analyzer before encoding the input sequences to identify detail irrelevant texture regions in the frame using convolutional neural networks. We designed and developed a new coding tool referred to as texture mode for AV1, where if texture mode is selected at the encoder, no inter-frame prediction is performed for the identified texture regions. Instead, displacement of the entire region is modeled by just one set of motion parameters. Therefore, only the model parameters are transmitted to the decoder for reconstructing the texture regions. Non-texture regions in the frame are coded conventionally. We show that for many standard test sets, the proposed method achieved significant data rate reductions."
"arXiv:1804.09497","Cédric Févotte, Matthieu Kowalski","eess.SP","Many state-of-the-art signal decomposition techniques rely on a low-rank factorization of a time-frequency (t-f) transform. In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) of the spectrogram has been considered in many audio applications. This is an analysis approach in the sense that the factorization is applied to the squared magnitude of the analysis coefficients returned by the t-f transform. In this paper we instead propose a synthesis approach, where low-rankness is imposed to the synthesis coefficients of the data signal over a given t-f dictionary (such as a Gabor frame). As such we offer a novel modeling paradigm that bridges t-f synthesis modeling and traditional analysis-based NMF approaches. The proposed generative model allows in turn to design more sophisticated multi-layer representations that can efficiently capture diverse forms of structure. Additionally, the generative modeling allows to exploit t-f low-rankness for compressive sensing. We present efficient iterative shrinkage algorithms to perform estimation in the proposed models and illustrate the capabilities of the new modeling paradigm over audio signal processing examples."

Killey, Polina Bayvel, Domaniç Lavery","eess.SP","Nonlinearity mitigation using digital signal processing has been shown to increase the achievable data rates of optical fiber transmission links. One especially effective technique is digital back propagation (DBP), an algorithm capable of simultaneously compensating for linear and nonlinear channel distortions. The most significant barrier to implementing this technique, however, is its high computational complexity. In recent years, there have been several proposed alternatives to DBP with reduced computational complexity, although such techniques have not demonstrated performance benefits commensurate with the complexity of implementation. In order to fully characterize the computational requirements of DBP, there is a need to model the algorithm behavior when constrained to the logic used in a digital coherent receiver. Such a model allows for the analysis of any signal recovery algorithm in terms of true hardware complexity which, crucially, includes the bit-depth of the multiplication operation. With a limited bit depth, there is quantization noise, introduced with each arithmetic operation, and it can no longer be assumed that the conventional DBP algorithm will outperform its low complexity alternatives. In this work, DBP and a single nonlinear step DBP implementation, the \textit{Enhanced Split Step Fourier} method (ESSFM), were compared with linear equalization using a generic software model of fixed point hardware. The requirements of bit depth and fast Fourier transform (FFT) size are discussed to examine the optimal operating regimes for these two schemes of digital nonlinearity compensation. For a 1000 km transmission system, it was found that (assuming an optimized FFT size), in terms of SNR, the ESSFM algorithm outperformed the conventional DBP for all hardware resolutions up to 13 bits."

It is a form of transfer learning, not in terms of the transfer of recognition decisions, but the knowledge of posteriori probabilities in the source domain as evaluated by the teacher model. It learns to handle the speaker and environment variability inherent in and restricted to the speech signal in the target domain without proactively addressing the robustness to other likely conditions. Performance degradation may thus ensue. In this work, we advance T/S learning by proposing adversarial T/S learning to explicitly achieve condition-robust unsupervised domain adaptation. In this method, a student acoustic model and a condition classifier are jointly optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher and student models, and simultaneously, to min-maximize the condition classification loss. A condition-invariant deep feature is learned in the adapted student model through this procedure. We further propose multi-factorial adversarial T/S learning which suppresses condition variabilities caused by multiple factors simultaneously.

Then, the receiver detects the information bits by only considering the molecules from the relay node. In the second case, the receiver considers both the types of molecules sent from the transmitter and the relay node. For these two scenarios, the optimal location of the relay node is obtained. We assume Quadruple Concentration Shift Keying (QCSK) modulation in which the signal is encoded into the four level concentrations of molecules emitted by the nano-machines.

The in-body capsule transmitter uses an ultrawideband outer-wall conformal loop antenna, whereas the on-body receiver uses a printed monopole antenna with a partial ground plane. A colon-equivalent tissue phantom and CST Gustav voxel human body model were used for the numerical studies of the capsule antenna. The simulation results in the colon-tissue phantom were validated through in-vitro measurements using a liquid phantom. According to the phantom simulations, the capsule antenna has -10 dB impedance matching from 309 to 1104 MHz. The ultrawideband characteristic enables the capsule antenna to tolerate the detuning effects due to electronic modules in the capsule and due to the proximity of various different tissues in gastrointestinal tracts. The on-body antenna was numerically evaluated on the colon-tissue phantom and the CST Gustav voxel human body model, followed by in-vitro and ex-vivo measurements for validation. The on-body antenna exceeds -10 dB impedance matching from 390 MHz to 500 MHz both in simulations and measurements.

An autoencoder is first trained to extract speaker-independent latent representations and speaker embedding separately using another auxiliary speaker classifier to regularize the latent representation. The decoder then takes the speaker-independent latent representation and the target speaker embedding as the input to generate the voice of the target speaker with the linguistic content of the source utterance. The quality of decoder output is further improved by patching with the residual signal produced by another pair of generator and discriminator.

Our analysis focuses on the comparison of patch antennas versus dipoles, representative for the antennas typically used in massive MIMO experiments today. Through simulations and measurements, we show that the finite patch array has a lower gain pattern variation compared with a dipole array. The impact of a large gain pattern variation on the massive MIMO system is that not all antennas contribute equally for all users, and the effective number of antennas seen for a single user is reduced.

However, if some of the sensors are providing lower quality outputs, the fused results can be degraded. In this work, a multi-sensor conflict measure is proposed which estimates multi-sensor conflict by representing each sensor output as interval-valued information and examines the sensor output overlaps on all possible n-tuple sensor combinations. The conflict is based on the sizes of the intervals and how many sensors output values lie in these intervals. In this work, conflict is defined in terms of how little the output from multiple sensors overlap. That is, high degrees of overlap mean low sensor conflict, while low degrees of overlap mean high conflict. This work is a preliminary step towards a robust conflict and sensor fusion framework. In addition, a sensor fusion algorithm is proposed based on a weighted sum of sensor outputs, where the weights for each sensor diminish as the conflict measure increases. The proposed methods can be utilized to (1) assess a measure of multi-sensor conflict, and (2) improve sensor output fusion by lessening weighting for sensors with high conflict. Using this measure, a simulated example is given to explain the mechanics of calculating the conflict measure, and stereo camera 3D outputs are analyzed and fused. In the stereo camera case, the sensor output is corrupted by additive impulse noise, DC offset, and Gaussian noise. Impulse noise is common in sensors due to intermittent interference, a DC offset a sensor bias or registration error, and Gaussian noise represents a sensor output with low SNR. The results show that sensor output fusion based on the conflict measure shows improved accuracy over a simple averaging fusion strategy."

As a result almost all video encoders have five to ten times more complexity than their decoders. In a video compression process, one of the main tasks at the encoder side is motion estimation which is to extract the temporal correlation between frames. Distributed video coding (DVC) proposed the idea that can lead to low complexity encoders and higher complexity decoders. DVC is a new paradigm in video compression based on the information theoretic ideas of Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv theorems. Wyner-Ziv coding is naturally robust against transmission errors and can be used for joint source and channel coding. Side Information is one of the key components of the Wyner-Ziv decoder. Better side information generation will result in better functionality of Wyner-Ziv coder. In this paper we proposed a new method that can generate side information with a better quality and thus better compression. We have used HVS (human visual system) based image quality metrics as our quality criterion. The motion estimation we used in the decoder is modified due to these metrics such that we could obtain finer side information. The motion compensation is optimized for perceptual quality metrics and leads to better side information generation compared to con- ventional MSE (mean squared error) or SAD (sum of absolute difference) based motion compensation currently used in the literature. Better motion compensation means better compression."

The question that arises here is what frame rate guarantees high viewing quality of experience given the existing/required 3D devices and technologies (3D cameras, 3D TVs, compression, transmission bandwidth, and storage capacity). This question has already been addressed for the case of 2D video, but not for 3D. The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between 3D quality and bitrate at different frame rates. Our performance evaluations show that increasing the frame rate of 3D videos beyond 60 fps may not be visually distinguishable. In addition, our experiments show that when the available bandwidth is reduced, the highest possible 3D quality of experience can be achieved by adjusting (decreasing) the frame rate instead of increasing the compression ratio. The results of our study are of particular interest to network providers for rate adaptation in variable bitrate channels."

Although saliency detection is well explored for 2D image and video content, there are only few attempts made to design 3D saliency prediction models. Newly proposed 3D visual attention models have to be validated over large-scale video saliency prediction datasets, which also contain results of eye-tracking information. There are several publicly available eye-tracking datasets for 2D image and video content. In the case of 3D, however, there is still a need for large-scale video saliency datasets for the research community for validating different 3D-VAMs. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset containing eye-tracking data collected from 61 stereoscopic 3D videos (and also 2D versions of those) and 24 subjects participated in a free-viewing test. We evaluate the performance of the existing saliency detection methods over the proposed dataset. In addition, we created an online benchmark for validating the performance of the existing 2D and 3D visual attention models and facilitate addition of new VAMs to the benchmark. Our benchmark currently contains 50 different VAMs."
"arXiv:1803.04030","Kanru Hua","eess.AS","This study focuses on generating fundamental frequency (F0) curves of singing voice from musical scores stored in a midi-like notation. Current statistical parametric approaches to singing F0 modeling meet difficulties in reproducing vibratos and the temporal details at note boundaries due to the oversmoothing tendency of statistical models. This paper presents a neural network based solution that models a pair of neighboring notes at a time (the transition model) and uses a separate network for generating vibratos (the sustain model). Predictions from the two models are combined by summation after proper enveloping to enforce continuity. In the training phase, mild misalignment between the scores and the target F0 is addressed by back-propagating the gradients to the networks' inputs. Subjective listening tests on the NITech singing database show that transition-sustain models are able to generate F0 trajectories close to the original performance."
"arXiv:1803.05417","Yi Sun","eess.IV","Most localization nanoscopy images are frame by frame localized images and little is known yet about the properties of their quality. We recently proposed root mean square minimum distance (RMSMD) as a universal quality metric for localization nanoscopy images. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of RMSMD for frame by frame localized nanoscopy images. It is shown that when the average number of activations per fluorophore λ reaches ten, acquiring more data frames is unnecessary in order to reduce the variance of RMSMD. Exploitation of temporal correlation embedded in a frame by frame localized nanoscopy image can reduce RMSMD by a maximum fold of λ^(0.5) and considerably improve the visual quality. Biases of localization errors affect RMSMD more severely than their variances. RMSMD is coincided with mean square error (MSE) in a region of small localization errors. As localization errors increase without bound, the RMSMD is eventually upper bounded. The effect of sample drafting on RMSMD is also analyzed. The results suggest the importance in developing two kinds of localization algorithms: the unbiased localization algorithms and the algorithms that can exploit temporal correlation in frame by frame localized nanoscopy images, which both need to pay more attention in future research."
"arXiv:1803.05671","Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Slawomir Stanczak","eess.SP","Important problems in wireless networks can often be solved by computing fixed points of standard or contractive interference mappings, and the conventional fixed point algorithm is widely used for this purpose. Knowing that the mapping used in the algorithm is not only standard but also contractive (or only contractive) is valuable information because we obtain a guarantee of geometric convergence rate, and the rate is related to a property of the mapping called modulus of contraction. To date, contractive mappings and their moduli of contraction have been identified with case-by-case approaches that can be difficult to generalize. To address this limitation of existing approaches, we show in this study that the spectral radii of asymptotic mappings can be used to identify an important subclass of contractive mappings and also to estimate their moduli of contraction. In addition, if the fixed point algorithm is applied to compute fixed points of positive concave mappings, we show that the spectral radii of asymptotic mappings provide us with simple lower bounds for the estimation error of the iterates. An immediate application of this result proves that a known algorithm for load estimation in wireless networks becomes slower with increasing traffic."

A practical solution is to automatically construct a two dimensional representation of the gastrointestinal tract for easy inspection. However, little has been done on wireless endoscopic image stitching, let alone systematic investigation. The proposed new wireless endoscopic image stitching method consists of two main steps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image registration. First, the keypoints are extracted by Principle Component Analysis and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (PCA-SIFT) algorithm and refined with Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) outlier removal to find the most reliable keypoints. Second, the optimal transformation parameters obtained from first step are fed to the Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) algorithm as an initial solution. With modified Marquardt-Levenberg search strategy in a multiscale framework, the NMI can find the optimal transformation parameters in the shortest time. The proposed methodology has been tested on two different datasets - one with real wireless endoscopic images and another with images obtained from Micro-Ball (a new wireless cubic endoscopy system with six image sensors). The results have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology both visually and quantitatively."

In this work we study the interplay of PS and phase recovery using the blind phase search (BPS) algorithm, which is currently a de-facto standard in optical communications systems. We first investigate a supervised phase search (SPS) algorithm as a theoretical upper bound on the BPS performance, assuming perfect decisions. It is shown that PS influences the SPS algorithm, but its impact can be alleviated by moderate noise-rejection window sizes. On the other hand, BPS is affected by PS even for long windows because of correlated erroneous decisions in the phase recovery scheme. The simulation results also showed that the capacity-maximizing shaping is near to the BPS worst-case situation for square QAM constellations, causing potential implementation penalties."

Darak, Rohit Kumar","eess.SP","Efficient utilization of licensed spectrum in the cognitive radio network is challenging due to lack of coordination among the Secondary Users (SUs). Distributed algorithms proposed in the literature aim to maximize the network throughput by ensuring orthogonal channel allocation for the SUs. However, these algorithms work under the assumption that all the SUs faithfully follow the algorithms which may not always hold due to the decentralized nature of the network. In this paper, we study distributed algorithms that are robust against malicious behavior (jamming attack). We consider both the cases of jammers launching coordinated and uncoordinated attacks. In the coordinated attack, the jammers select non-overlapping channels to attack in each time slot and can significantly increase the number of collisions for SUs. We setup the problem in each scenario as a multi-player bandit and develop algorithms. The analysis shows that when the SUs faithfully implement proposed algorithms, the regret is constant with high probability. We validate our claims through exhaustive synthetic experiments and also through a realistic USRP based experiments."

One of the major drawbacks in mobile satellite communications is the fact that the power budget is often restrictive, making unaffordable to improve the spectral efficiency without an increment of transmitted power. By using dual polarized antennas in the transmitter and receiver, the PMod technique achieves an improvement in throughput of up to $100$\% with respect to existing deployments, with an increase of less than $1$ dB at low \ebn regime. Additionally, the proposed scheme implies minimum hardware modifications with respect to the existing dual polarized systems and does not require additional channel state information at the transmitter; thus it can be used in current deployments. Demodulation (i.e. detection and decoding) alternatives, with different processing complexity and performance, are studied.

The performance of locally-normalized filter bank (LNFB) and Mel filter bank (MelFB) features in combination with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Suppression of Slowly-varying components and the Falling edge (SSF) and Weighted Prediction Error (WPE) enhancement methods are discussed and evaluated. Two training conditions were considered: clean and reverberated (Reverb). With Reverb training the use of WPE and LNFB provides WERs that are 3% and 20% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. WPE and MelFB provides WERs that are 11% and 24% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. With clean training, which represents a significant mismatch between testing and training conditions, LNFB features clearly outperform MelFB features. The results show that different types of training, parametrization, and enhancement techniques may work better for a specific combination of speaker-microphone distance and reverberation time. This suggests that there could be some degree of complementarity between systems trained with different enhancement and parametrization methods."

To improve the DNN performance, we combine it with the weighted prediction error (WPE) method that shows a complementary behavior. While this combination provided a reduction in WER of approximately 11% when compared with the baseline, the observed improvement is not as great as that obtained using WPE alone. However, modifications to the DNN training process were applied and an average reduction in WER equal to 18.3% was achieved when compared with the baseline system.

It uses adaptive tensor product to construct multidimensional points until a predefined error tolerance level is reached. The performance of the proposed filter is illustrated with two nonlinear filtering problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm achieves a similar accuracy as compared to sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite filter (SGHF) and Gauss-Hermite filter (GHF) with a considerable reduction in computational load. Further, in the conventional GHF and SGHF, any increase in the accuracy level may result in an unacceptably high increase in the computational burden.

The ISDF strategy utilizes the relay only if the direct link quality fails to attain a certain information rate, thereby improving the spectral efficiency. The path gain is assumed to be log-normally distributed with very high distance dependent signal attenuation. Furthermore, the additive noise is modeled as a Bernoulli-Gaussian process to incorporate the effects of impulsive noise contents. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the fraction of times the relay is in use, and an approximate closed-form expression for the average bit error rate (BER) are derived for the binary phase-shift keying signaling scheme.

Furthermore, we provide a qualitative comparison of models trained for different distortion metrics."

Recently, convolutional neural network (ConvNet) has achieved remarkable performance in different tasks, and significant efforts have been made to develop various representations for satellite image scene classification. In this paper, we present a novel representation based on a deeper ConvNet with context aggregation. The proposed two-pathway ResNet (ResNet-TP) architecture adopts the ResNet [1] as backbone, and the two pathways allow the network to model both local details and regional context. The ResNet-TP based representation is generated by global average pooling on the last convolutional layers from both pathways. Experiments on two scene classification datasets, UCM Land Use and NWPU-RESISC45, show that the proposed mechanism achieves promising improvements over state-of-the-art methods."

There have been a tremendous amount of attempts to detect these points from facial images however, there has never been an attempt to synthesize a random face and generate its corresponding facial landmarks. This paper presents a framework for augmenting a dataset in a latent Z-space and applied to the regression problem of generating a corresponding set of landmarks from a 2D facial dataset. The BEGAN framework has been used to train a face generator from CelebA database. The inverse of the generator is implemented using an Adam optimizer to generate the latent vector corresponding to each facial image, and a lightweight deep neural network is trained to map latent Z-space vectors to the landmark space. Initial results are promising and provide a generic methodology to augment annotated image datasets with additional intermediate samples."

The accurate segmentation of subcortical brain structures is crucial to the study of gliomas in that it helps the monitoring of the progression of gliomas and aids the evaluation of treatment outcomes. However, the large amount of required human labor makes it difficult to obtain the manually segmented Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. In this work, we try to address this problem by developing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network~(3D CNN) based model to automatically segment gliomas. The major difficulty of our segmentation model comes with the fact that the location, structure, and shape of gliomas vary significantly among different patients. In order to accurately classify each voxel, our model captures multi-scale contextual information by extracting features from two scales of receptive fields. To fully exploit the tumor structure, we propose a novel architecture that hierarchically segments different lesion regions of the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor~(NCR/NET), peritumoral edema~(ED) and GD-enhancing tumor~(ET). Additionally, we utilize densely connected convolutional blocks to further boost the performance. We train our model with a patch-wise training schema to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The proposed method is validated on the BraTS 2017 dataset and it achieves Dice scores of 0.72, 0.83 and 0.81 for the complete tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. These results are comparable to the reported state-of-the-art results, and our method is better than existing 3D-based methods in terms of compactness, time and space efficiency."
"arXiv:1802.01358","MohamadMahdi Mohades, Mohamad Hossein Kahaei","eess.SP","In this paper, deterministic construction of measurement matrices in Compressive Sensing (CS) is considered. First, by employing the column replacement concept, a theorem for construction of large minimum distance linear codes containing all-one codewords is proposed. Then, by applying an existing theorem over these linear codes, deterministic sensing matrices are constructed. To evaluate this procedure, two examples of constructed sensing matrices are presented. The first example contains a matrix of size ${{p}^{2}}\times {{p}^{3}}$ and coherence ${1}/{p}\;$, and the second one comprises a matrix with the size $p\left( p-1 \right)\times {{p}^{3}}$ and coherence ${1}/{\left( p-1 \right)}\;$, where $p$ is a prime integer. Based on the Welch bound, both examples asymptotically achieve optimal results. Moreover, by presenting a new theorem, the column replacement is used for resizing any sensing matrix to a greater-size sensing matrix whose coherence is calculated. Then, using an example, the outperformance of the proposed method is compared to a well-known method. Simulation results show the satisfying performance of the column replacement method either in created or resized sensing matrices."

Dictionary learning approaches have been widely used for tasks such as low-level signal denoising and restoration as well as high-level classification tasks, which can be applied to audio and image analysis. Synthesis dictionary learning aims at jointly learning a dictionary and corresponding sparse coefficients to provide accurate data representation. This approach is useful for denoising and signal restoration, but may lead to sub-optimal classification performance. By contrast, analysis dictionary learning provides a transform that maps data to a sparse discriminative representation suitable for classification. We consider the problem of analysis dictionary learning for time-series data under a weak supervision setting in which signals are assigned with a global label instead of an instantaneous label signal. We propose a discriminative probabilistic model that incorporates both label information and sparsity constraints on the underlying latent instantaneous label signal using cardinality control. We present the expectation maximization (EM) procedure for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the proposed model. To facilitate a computationally efficient E-step, we propose both a chain and a novel tree graph reformulation of the graphical model.

In essence, this domain simultaneously incorporates quantization both in amplitude and time, i.e. amplitude quantization and uniform time sampling. Thus, we view A/D conversion as a sampling process in both the time and amplitude domains based on the observation that the underlying continuous-time signals representing digital sequences can be sampled in a lattice---i.e. at points restricted to lie in a uniform grid both in time and amplitude. We refer to them as lattice functions. This is in contrast with the traditional approach based on the classical sampling theorem and quantization error analysis. The latter has been mainly addressed with the help of probabilistic models, or deterministic ones either confined to very particular scenarios or considering worst-case assumptions. In this paper, we provide a deterministic theoretical analysis and framework for the functions involved in digital discrete-time processing. We show that lattice functions possess a rich analytic structure in the context of integral-valued entire functions of exponential type. We derive set and spectral properties of this class of functions. This allows us to prove in a deterministic way and for general bandlimited functions a fundamental bound on the spectrum of the quantization error that is independent of the resolution of the quantizer."

Cox, H. du Toit Mouton","eess.SP","We analyse the nonlinear behaviour of a third-order class-D amplifier, and demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal (pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability, we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal that slowly modulates the system parameters."

Hassan, Nicolo Michelusi","eess.SP","Millimeter-wave communications is the most promising technology for next-generation cellular wireless systems, thanks to the large bandwidth available compared to sub-6 GHz networks. Nevertheless, communication at these frequencies requires narrow beams via massive MIMO and beamforming to overcome the strong signal attenuation, and thus precise beam-alignment between transmitter and receiver is needed. The resulting signaling overhead may become a severe impairment, especially in mobile networks with high users density. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the beam-alignment protocol to minimize the signaling overhead. In this paper, the design of energy efficient joint beam-alignment protocols for two users is addressed, with the goal to minimize the power consumption during data transmission, subject to rate constraints for both users, under analog beamforming constraints. It is proved that a bisection search algorithm is optimal. Additionally, the optimal scheduling strategy of the two users in the data communication phase is optimized based on the outcome of beam-alignment, according to a time division multiplexing scheme. The numerical results show significant decrease in the power consumption for the proposed joint beam-alignment scheme compared to exhaustive search and a single-user beam-alignment scheme taking place separately for each user."

In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for this minimal distortion as a function of the bitrate and the decimation factor. Next, we consider a compress-and-estimate (CE) source coding scheme, in which the encoder first compresses the decimated sequence subject to an MSE criterion (with respect to the decimated sequence), and the original random walk is estimated only at the decoder.

In this paper, a novel algorithm, named modified-sparse-MV (MS-MV) is proposed in which a L1-norm constraint is added to the MV minimization problem after some modifications, in order to suppress the sidelobes more efficiently, compared to MV. The added constraint can be interpreted as the sparsity of the output of the MV beamformed signals. Since the final minimization problem is convex, it can be solved efficiently using a simple iterative algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed method, MS-MV beamformer, improves the signal-to-noise (SNR) about 19.48 dB, in average, compared to MV. Also, the experimental results, using a wire-target phantom, show that MS-MV leads to SNR improvement of about 2.64 dB in comparison with the MV."
"arXiv:1801.01111","Adnan Quadri","eess.SP","One of the fundamental challenges affecting the performance of communication systems is the undesired impact of noise on a signal. Noise distorts the signal and originates due to several sources including, system non-linearity and noise interference from adjacent environment. Conventional communication systems use filters to cancel noise in a received signal. In the case of cognitive radio systems, denoising a signal is important during the spectrum sensing period, and also during communication with other network nodes. Based on our findings, few surveys are found that only review particular denoising techniques employed for the spectrum sensing phase of cognitive radio communication. This paper aims to provide a collective review of denoising techniques that can be applied to a cognitive radio system during all the phases of cognitive communication and discusses several works where the denoising techniques are employed. To establish comprehensive overview, a performance comparison of the discussed denoising techniques are also provided."

Literature mainly has focused on designing the best global threshold. However, this paper proposes a new denoising method using bivariate shrinkage function in framelet domain. In the proposed method, maximum aposteriori probability is used for estimate of the denoised coefficient and non-Gaussian bivariate function is applied to model the statistics of framelet coefficients. For every framelet coefficient, there is a corresponding threshold depending on the local statistics of framelet coefficients.

The impacts of both the urban road network and the power grid network on charging station planning are also considered. At each planning stage, the optimal station placement strategy is derived through solving a Bayesian game among the service providers.

The simulation results demonstrate a strong consistency between the charging station placement and the traffic flow of EVs. The results also reveal an interesting phenomenon that service providers prefer clustering instead of spatial separation in this oligopoly market."

A transient decrease in frequency, referred to as slowing, is a generally abnormal but not necessarily epileptic EEG variant. Seizure termination is often associated with a period of slowing between the period of peak amplitude and frequency of the seizure and the return to baseline. In annotation of seizure events in the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus, independent slowing events were identified as a major source of false alarm error. Preliminary results demonstrated the difficulty in automatic differentiation between seizure events and independent slowing events. The TUH EEG Slowing database, a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus, was created, and is introduced here, to aid in the development of a seizure detection tool that can differentiate between slowing at the end of a seizure and an independent non-seizure slowing event. The corpus contains 100 10-second samples each of background, slowing, and seizure events.

There are numerous compelling applications in healthcare that can benefit from high performance automated decision support systems provided by deep learning technology, but they lack the comprehensive data resources required to apply sophisticated machine learning models. Further, for economic reasons, it is very difficult to justify the creation of large annotated corpora for these applications. Hence, automated annotation techniques become increasingly important. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of using an active learning algorithm to automatically annotate a large EEG corpus. The algorithm is designed to annotate six types of EEG events. Two model training schemes, namely threshold-based and volume-based, are evaluated. In the threshold-based scheme the threshold of confidence scores is optimized in the initial training iteration, whereas for the volume-based scheme only a certain amount of data is preserved after each iteration. Recognition performance is improved 2% absolute and the system is capable of automatically annotating previously unlabeled data. Given that the interpretation of clinical EEG data is an exceedingly difficult task, this study provides some evidence that the proposed method is a viable alternative to expensive manual annotation."

We propose to have centralized network functions in the 5G network core to control the network, end-to-end. This is achieved by relocating the control functionality present in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) to the network core, resulting in the conversion of the base station known as the gNB into a pure data plane node. This brings about a significant reduction in signaling costs between the RAN and the core network. It also results in improved system performance. The merits of our proposal have been illustrated by evaluating the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the 5G network, such as network attach (registration) time and handover time. We have also demonstrated improvements in attach time and system throughput due to the use of centralized algorithms for mobility management with the help of ns-3 simulations."

For more detailed ground images the camera resolutions are steadily increasing. Simultaneously the amount of video data to transmit is increasing significantly, too. To reduce the amount of data, Region of Interest (ROI) coding systems were introduced which mainly encode some regions in higher quality at the cost of the remaining image regions. We employ an existing ROI coding system relying on global motion compensation to retain full image resolution over the entire image. Different ROI detectors are used to automatically classify a video image on board of the UAV in ROI and non-ROI. We propose to replace the modified Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video encoder by a modified High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoder. Without any change of the detection system itself, but by replacing the video coding back-end we are able to improve the coding efficiency by 32% on average although regular HEVC provides coding gains of 12-30% only for the same test sequences and similar PSNR compared to regular AVC coding. Since the employed ROI coding mainly relies on intra mode coding of new emerging image areas, gains of HEVC-ROI coding over AVC-ROI coding compared to regular coding of the entire frames including predictive modes (inter) depend on sequence characteristics. We present a detailed analysis of bit distribution within the frames to explain the gains.

To perform object-oriented image classification, the studied image must first be segmented in uniform regions. This segmentation requires manual work by an expert user, who must exhaustively explore the image to establish thresholds that generate useful and representative segments without oversegmenting and without discarding representative segments. We propose a technique that automatically segments the multispectral image while facing these issues. We identify in the image homogenous zones according to their spectral signatures through the use of morphological filters. These homogenous zones are representatives of different types of land coverings in the image and are used as seeds for the GrowCut multispectral segmentation algorithm. GrowCut is a cellular automaton with competitive region growth, its cells are linked to every pixel in the image through three parameters: the pixel's spectral signature, a label, and a strength factor that represents the strength with which a cell defends its label. The seed cells possess maximum strength and maintain their state throughout the automaton's evolution. Starting from seed cells, each cell in the image is iteratively attacked by its neighboring cells. When the automaton stops updating its states, we obtain a segmented image where each pixel has taken the label of one of its cells. In this paper the algorithm was applied in an image acquired by Landsat8 on agricultural land of Calabozo, Guarico, Venezuela where there are different types of land coverings: agriculture, urban regions, water bodies, and savannas with different degrees of human intervention. The segmentation obtained is presented as irregular polygons enclosing geographical objects."

Therefore, we propose using two dimensional generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (2D-GARCH) model that is compatible with the contourlet coefficients. Motivated by the modeling results, we design a new watermark detector based on 2D-GARCH model. Also, we analyze its performance by computing the receiver operating characteristics. Experimental results confirm the high efficiency of the proposed detector.

Millar, Toshiaki Koike-Akino, Keisuke Kojima, Kieran Parsons","eess.SP","Distribution matching is a fixed-length invertible mapping from a uniformly distributed bit sequence to shaped amplitudes and as such plays an important role in the probabilistic amplitude shaping framework. With conventional constantcomposition distribution matching (CCDM), all output sequences have identical composition. In this paper, we propose partitionbased distribution matching (PBDM) where the composition is constant over all output sequences. When considering the desired distribution as a multiset, PBDM corresponds to partitioning this multiset into equal-size subsets. We show that PBDM allows to address more output sequences and thus has lower rate loss than CCDM in all nontrivial cases. By imposing some constraints on the partitioning, a constructive PBDM algorithm is proposed which comprises two parts. A variable-length prefix of the binary data word determines the composition to be used, and the remainder of the input word is mapped with a conventional CCDM algorithm, such as arithmetic coding, according to the chosen composition. For a specific target distribution and a fixed rate loss, we numerically find that PBDM gives a four-fold reduction in block length in comparison to CCDM. Simulations of 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation over the additive white Gaussian noise channel demonstrate that the block-length saving of PBDM over CCDM for a fixed gap to capacity varies with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and is approximately a factor of 2.5 to 5 at medium and high SNRs, respectively."

The proposed learning paradigm is significantly different from the conventional kernel-based learning paradigm in two senses: (i) the whole space is not a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and (ii) the minimum mean squared error estimator gives the best approximation of the desired nonlinear function in the dictionary subspace. It preserves efficiency in computing the inner product as well as in updating the Gram matrix when the dictionary grows.

However, one of its main drawbacks is significant spectral leakage due to the accumulation of multiple sinc-shaped subcarriers. In this paper, we present a novel pulse shaping scheme for efficient spectral leakage suppression in OFDM based physical layer of IEEE 802.11af standard. With conventional pulse shaping filters such as a raised-cosine filter, vestigial symmetry can be used to reduce spectral leakage very effectively. However, these pulse shaping filters require long guard interval, i.e., cyclic prefix in an OFDM system, to avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI), resulting in a loss of spectral efficiency. The proposed pulse shaping method based on asymmetric pulse shaping achieves better spectral leakage suppression and decreases ISI caused by filtering as compared to conventional pulse shaping filters."

"arXiv:1712.07630","Zhe Yang, Lin Cai, Aaron Gulliver, Liang He, Jianping Pan","eess.SP","Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is widely employed in modern wireless communication systems to improve the transmission efficiency by adjusting the transmission rate according to the channel conditions. Thus, AMC can provide very efficient use of channel resources especially over fading channels. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is an ef- ficient and widely employed digital modulation technique. It typically employs a rectangular signal constellation. Therefore the decision regions of the constellation are square partitions of the two-dimensional signal space. However, it is well known that hexagons rather than squares provide the most compact regular tiling in two dimensions. A compact tiling means a dense packing of the constellation points and thus more energy efficient data transmission. Hexagonal modulation can be difficult to implement because it does not fit well with the usual power- of-two symbol sizes employed with binary data. To overcome this problem, non-binary coding is combined with hexagonal modulation in this paper to provide a system which is compatible with binary data. The feasibility and efficiency are evaluated using a software-defined radio (SDR) based prototype. Extensive simulation results are presented which show that this approach can provide improved energy efficiency and spectrum utilization in wireless communication systems."

Schiff","eess.IV","Objective: Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Segmentation of brain imagery into brain tissue and CSF (before and after surgery, i.e. pre-op vs. postop) plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of pre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well researched. However, segmenting post-operative (post-op) computational tomographic (CT)-scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and subdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity and feature based segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as subdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity varies with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats segmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e. a training set of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. Methods: Our contributions include: 1.) a dictionary learning framework that learns class (segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples from the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other classes, 2.) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint, and 3.) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op hydrocephalic CT images. Results: Experiments performed on infant CT brain images acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success of our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a graceful degradation against number of training samples, enhancing its deployment potential."

This paper introduces a novel scheme that facilitates energy beamforming by utilizing Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to estimate the channel. Firstly, in the training stage, the ET will transmit sequentially using each beamforming vector in a codebook, which is pre-defined using a Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis. The RSSI value corresponding to each beamforming vector is fed back to the ET, and these values are used to estimate the channel through a maximum likelihood analysis. The results that are obtained are remarkably simple, requires minimal processing, and can be easily implemented. Also, the results are general and hold for all well known fading models. The paper also validates the analytical results numerically, as well as experimentally, and it is shown that the proposed method achieves impressive results in wireless energy transfer."

The first reconstruction network is a compatibly sampling reconstruction network (CSRNet), which recovers an image from its compressively sensed measurement sampled by a traditional random matrix. In CSRNet, deep reconstruction network module obtains an initial image with acceptable quality, which can be further improved by residual network module based on convolutional neural network. The second reconstruction network is adaptively sampling reconstruction network (ASRNet), by matching automatically sampling module with corresponding residual reconstruction module. The experimental results have shown that the proposed two reconstruction networks outperform several state-of-the-art compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms.

Therefore a heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model is introduced where the variance can vary across observations and sensors. The source amplitudes are assumed independent zero-mean complex Gaussian distributed with unknown variances (i.e. the source powers), inspiring stochastic maximum likelihood DOA estimation. The DOAs of plane waves are estimated from multi-snapshot sensor array data using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) where the noise is estimated across both sensors and snapshots. This SBL approach is more flexible and performs better than high-resolution methods since they cannot estimate the heteroscedastic noise process. An alternative to SBL is simple data normalization, whereby only the phase across the array is utilized. Simulations demonstrate that taking the heteroscedastic noise into account improves DOA estimation."

Moreover, the base station transfers power to the nodes by using Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) to extend their battery life. However, inadequately scheduling WPT and data collection causes some of the nodes to drain their battery and have their data buffer overflow, while the other nodes waste their harvested energy, which is more than they need to transmit their packets. In this paper, we investigate a novel optimal scheduling strategy, called EHMDP, aiming to minimize data packet loss from a network of sensor nodes in terms of the nodes' energy consumption and data queue state information. The scheduling problem is first formulated by a centralized MDP model, assuming that the complete states of each node are well known by the base station. This presents the upper bound of the data that can be collected in a rechargeable wireless sensor network. Next, we relax the assumption of the availability of full state information so that the data transmission and WPT can be semi-decentralized.

Some examples of filters and of their implementations are given. Finally, as alternate representations of graph signals, we focus on multiscale transforms that are defined from filters. Continuous multiscale transforms such as spectral wavelets on graphs are reviewed, as well as the versatile approaches of filterbanks on graphs.

We restrict the notations to 7 notes and suppress the finer note position information. A dictionary based approach captures the statistics of repetitive note patterns within a raga notation. The proposed stochastic models of repetitive note patterns (or SMRNP in short) obtained from raga notations of known compositions, outperforms the state of the art melody based raga identification technique on an equivalent melodic data corresponding to the same compositions.

A group of nonlocal similar patches form a 4D tensor for which a nonlocal higher order dictionary is learned via higher order singular value decomposition. The multiple sub-dictionaries contained in the higher order dictionary decorrelate the group in each corresponding dimension, thus help the detail of color images to be reconstructed better. Furthermore, we promote sparsity of the final solution using a sparsity regularization based on a weight tensor. It can distinguish those coefficients of the sparse representation generated by the higher order dictionary which are expected to have large magnitude from the others in the optimization.

In this paper, we examine this issue and we describe our approach to the generation of realistic corpora in a domestic context. Experimental validation, conducted in a multi-microphone scenario, shows that a comparable performance trend can be observed with both real and simulated data across different recognition frameworks, acoustic models, as well as multi-microphone processing techniques."

Olmos","eess.SP","This manuscript has been submitted to Transactions on Communications on September 7, 2017; revised on January 10, 2018 and March 27, 2018; and it is currently under review.  We propose a novel filter-type equalizer to improve the solution of the linear minimum-mean squared-error (LMMSE) turbo equalizer, with computational complexity constrained to be quadratic in the filter length. When high-order modulations and/or large memory channels are used the optimal BCJR equalizer is unavailable, due to its computational complexity. In this scenario, the filter-type LMMSE turbo equalization exhibits a good performance compared to other approximations. In this paper, we show that this solution can be significantly improved by using expectation propagation (EP) in the estimation of the a posteriori probabilities. First, it yields a more accurate estimation of the extrinsic distribution to be sent to the channel decoder. Second, compared to other solutions based on EP the computational complexity of the proposed solution is constrained to be quadratic in the length of the finite impulse response (FIR). In addition, we review previous EP-based turbo equalization implementations. Instead of considering default uniform priors we exploit the outputs of the decoder. Some simulation results are included to show that this new EP-based filter remarkably outperforms the turbo approach of previous versions of the EP algorithm and also improves the LMMSE solution, with and without turbo equalization."
"arXiv:1711.05837","Saandeep Depatla, Yasamin Mostofi","eess.SP","Counting the number of people inside a building, from outside and without entering the building, is crucial for many applications. In this paper, we are interested in counting the total number of people walking inside a building (or in general behind walls), using readily-deployable WiFi transceivers that are installed outside the building, and only based on WiFi RSSI measurements. The key observation of the paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to the dip events of the received signal, are fairly robust to the attenuation through walls (for instance as compared to the exact dip values). We then propose a methodology that can extract the total number of people from the inter-event times. More specifically, we first show how to characterize the wireless received power measurements as a superposition of renewal-type processes. By borrowing theories from the renewal-process literature, we then show how the probability mass function of the inter-event times carries vital information on the number of people. We validate our framework with 44 experiments in five different areas on our campus (3 classrooms, a conference room, and a hallway), using only one WiFi transmitter and receiver installed outside of the building, and for up to and including 20 people. Our experiments further include areas with different wall materials, such as concrete, plaster, and wood, to validate the robustness of the proposed approach. Overall, our results show that our approach can estimate the total number of people behind the walls with a high accuracy while minimizing the need for prior calibrations."
"arXiv:1711.05855","Saandeep Depatla, Yasamin Mostofi","eess.SP","In this paper, we propose a methodology for estimating the crowd speed using WiFi devices without relying on people to carry any device. Our approach not only enables speed estimation in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions. More specifically, we use a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose RSSI measurements are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this region, but also in adjacent WiFi-free regions. We first prove how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing the two links implicitly carry key information about the pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical model to relate them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with 108 experiments, in both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10 people walk in two adjacent areas, with variety of speeds per region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate these speeds with only a pair of WiFi links in one region. For instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. We also evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting and estimate the popularity of different exhibits. We finally run experiments in an aisle in Costco, estimating key attributes of buyers' behaviors."

Kumar","eess.SP","This paper introduces a new computational framework to account for uncertainties in day-ahead electricity market clearing process in the presence of demand response providers. A central challenge when dealing with many demand response providers is the uncertainty of its realization. In this paper, a new economic dispatch framework that is based on the recent theoretical development of the scenario approach is introduced. By removing samples from a finite uncertainty set, this approach improves dispatch performance while guaranteeing a quantifiable risk level with respect to the probability of violating the constraints. The theoretical bound on the level of risk is shown to be a function of the number of scenarios removed. This is appealing to the system operator for the following reasons: (1) the improvement of performance comes at the cost of a quantifiable level of violation probability in the constraints; (2) the violation upper bound does not depend on the probability distribution assumption of the uncertainty in demand response. Numerical simulations on (1) 3-bus and (2) IEEE 14-bus system (3) IEEE 118-bus system suggest that this approach could be a promising alternative in future electricity markets with multiple demand response providers."

We proposed a robust technique to detect, based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, a point-like target embedded in compound Gaussian clutter. Employing an array of antennas, we assume that the actual steering vector departs from the nominal one, but lies in a known interval. The detection is then secured by employing a semi-definite programming.

The study is focused on the investigation of various building materials each having a different roughness, at a central frequency of 60GHz. Very large signal strength variations in first order scattered components is observed as the user moves over very short distances. This is due to the small-scale fading caused by rough surface scatterers. Furthermore, it is shown that the diffused scattering depends on the material roughness, the angle of incidence and the distance from the surface. Finally, results indicate that reflections from rough materials may suffer from high depolarization, a phenomenon that can potentially be exploited in order to improve the performance of mm-Wave systems using polarization diversity."

When extended to graph signal processing (GSP), this would mean that a shift-invariant graph filter can be represented as a polynomial of the adjacency (shift) matrix of the graph. However, the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the adjacency matrix must be identical for the property to hold. While it has been suggested that this condition might be ignored as it is always possible to find a polynomial transform to represent the original adjacency matrix by another adjacency matrix that satisfies the condition, this letter shows that a filter that is shift invariant in terms of the original graph may not be shift invariant anymore under the modified graph and vice versa. We introduce the notion of "shift-enabled graph" for graphs that satisfy the aforementioned condition, and present a concrete example of a graph that is not "shift-enabled" and a shift-invariant filter that is not a polynomial of the shift operation matrix. The result provides a deeper understanding of shift-invariant filters when applied in GSP and shows that further investigation of shift-enabled graphs is needed to make it applicable to practical scenarios."

To this end, new models are put forth to account for the stochastic RES harvesting, two-way energy trading, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based energy transaction cost. Capitalizing on these models, we propose a distributed CMBF solution to minimize the grid-wide transaction cost subject to user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, relying on state-of-the-art optimization tools, we show that the relevant task can be formulated as a convex problem that is well suited for development of a distributed solver.

More precisely, in this case any finite number of last terms of the error series do not tend to any finite or infinite values.

In particular, the common problem of estimating the value of a vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements is at the core of a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and sonar, biomedicine, image processing, and seismology, just to name a few. Developing an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the measured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct, fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements. Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present. Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further, understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical literature in the last fifty years. Secondly, some applications are discussed to illustrate the broad range of areas and problems to which this framework extends, and consequently the numerous opportunities available for SP researchers."

Therefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing prioritized loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation method. The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability evaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through Monte- Carlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the reliability enhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology.

Indoor channel measurements at 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band have been performed using a versatile channel sounder testbed platform. A single transmitting antenna, four receiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receiver circuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploiting baseband signal processing techniques.

Green","eess.SP","Pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) have proved to be useful in the estimation of respiratory rates (RR) in adult patients. However, PSM technology has not been extensively applied to derive physiologic parameters in infant and neonatal patients. This research evaluates the applicability of the capacitive XSensor PSM technology to estimate a range of RR in neonatal patient simulator trials conducted under several experimental conditions. PSM data are analyzed in both the time and frequency domain and comparative results are presented. For the frequency-domain approach, in addition to estimating RR, a measure of confidence is also derived from the relative height of peaks in the periodogram. The study demonstrates that frequency domain analysis of mean-shifted PSM data achieves the best possible RR estimation, with zero percent error, as compared to the lowest achievable RMS error of 1.57 percent in the time domain. The frequency domain approach outperforms the time domain analysis whether examining raw data or those preprocessed by normalizing, detrending and median filtering."

For fault diagnosis, a cost-sensitive deep belief network (namely ECS-DBN) is applied to deal with the imbalanced data problem for tool state estimation. An appropriate prognostic degradation model is then applied for tool wear estimation based on the different tool states. The proposed framework has the advantage of automatic feature representation learning and shows better performance in accuracy and robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed DBNMS is validated using a real-world dataset obtained from the gun drilling process. This dataset contains a large amount of measured signals involving different tool geometries under various operating conditions. The DBNMS is examined for both the tool state estimation and tool wear estimation tasks.

Use of efficient link switching scheme among VLC access points is critical in indoor environment to provide seamless connectivity to mobile users. This paper presents a novel position prediction link switching scheme for indoor visible light communication systems. The method exploits the fact that indoor scenario (light fixtures/furniture) mostly remains unchanged, therefore, this information can be stored at the coordinator end. Thus, the user is not required to search for the best transmitter when RSS is reduced to a threshold value as in conventional methods which cause substantial delay in switching process.

To support the mMTC communication, an uplink (UL) grant-free sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system has been proposed. In this system, the knowledge of user equipments' (UEs') status should be obtained before decoding the data by a message passing algorithm (MPA). An existing solution is to use the compressive sensing (CS) theory to detect active UEs under the assumed condition of flat fading channel. But the assumed condition is not suitable for the frequency selective channel and will decrease the accuracy of active UEs detection. This paper proposes a new simple module named refined active UE detector (RAUD), which is based on frequency selective channel gain analyzing. By making full use of the channel gain and analyzing the difference between characteristic values of the two status of UEs, RAUD module can enhance the active UEs detection accuracy.

To address the point cloud denoising problem, we propose a fast graph-based local algorithm. Specifically, given a k-nearest-neighbor graph of the 3D points, we first approximate it with a bipartite graph(independent sets of red and blue nodes) using a KL divergence criterion. For each partite of nodes (say red), we first define surface normal of each red node using 3D coordinates of neighboring blue nodes, so that red node normals n can be written as a linear function of red node coordinates p. We then formulate a convex optimization problem, with a quadratic fidelity term ||p-q||_2^2 given noisy observed red coordinates q and a graph total variation (GTV) regularization term for surface normals of neighboring red nodes. We minimize the resulting l2-l1-norm using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent. The two partites of nodes are alternately optimized until convergence.

Its numerical cost scales linearly with the number of measured samples. Regularization is obtained by minimizing the norms of the convolution between the reconstructed image and a set of spatial filters, and the final reconstruction formula can be expressed in terms of matrix pseudoinverse. At high compression this approach is an interesting alternative to the methods of compressive sensing based on l1-norm optimization, which are too slow for real-time applications. For instance, we demonstrate experimental single-pixel detection with real-time reconstruction obtained in parallel with the measurement at the frame rate of $11$ Hz for highly compressive measurements with the resolution of $256\times 256$. For this purpose, we preselect the sampling functions to match the average spectrum obtained with an image database. The sampling functions are selected from the Walsh-Hadamard basis, from the discrete cosine basis, or from a subset of Morlet wavelets convolved with white noise. We show that by incorporating the quadratic criterion into the closed-form reconstruction formula, we are able to use binary rather than continuous sampling reaching similar reconstruction quality as is obtained by minimizing the total variation. This makes it possible to use cosine or Morlet-based sampling with digital micromirror devices without advanced binarization methods."

We specifically also analyze how realistic highly nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) affect the achievable DL performance, as the individual PA units in large-array or massive MIMO systems are expected to be small, cheap and operating close to saturation for increased energy-efficiency purposes. It is shown that the largely reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the PA input signals in the CE precoder based system allows for pushing the PA units harsher towards saturation, while allowing to reach higher signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINRs) at the intended receivers compared to the classical ZF precoder based system. The obtained results indicate that the CE precoder can outperform the ZF precoder by up to 5-6 dBs, in terms of the achievable SINRs, when the PA units are pushed towards their saturating region.

Recently, the electromagnetic (EM) wave was found to possess not only linear momentum, but also angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a kind of wavefront with helical phase. The OAM-based vortex wave has different topological charges, which are orthogonal to each other, bridging a new way for multiple access in wireless communications. In this article, we introduce the fundamental theory of OAM and the OAM based wireless communications. The research challenges regarding OAM signal generation, OAM beam converging, and OAM signal reception are discussed. Further, we propose a new multiuser access with different OAM-modes in wireless networks, where multiple OAM-modes are used as a new orthogonal dimension for interference avoidance. Simulation results reveal the inherent property of OAM waves and show that OAM based radio transmission can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency in wireless networks."

Otherwise, the generating station might experience frequent shut downs which results in electricity generation interruptions and high costs associated with repairing and compensation of lack of energy. In this sense, many protective schemes focusing on a variety of synchronous generator faults have already been proposed and are still modified and developed to further enhance the quality of protection. In this thesis, synchronous generator stator windings to ground fault is studied as one of the most common and crucial faults in these machines. Numerous methods of stator winding to ground fault protection schemes are also reported in the literature. Third harmonic differential voltage and sub-harmonic schemes are studied in this research. A novel adaptive scheme for both methods is modelled and implemented in a comprehensive lab scale set-up where a real generation unit is scaled down including all different components and apparatus. The simulation model is also established based on simultaneous finite element analysis (FEA) and coupled magnetic circuit to assist with system configuration design and parameter selections. The adaptive scheme is proved to be capable of detecting stator windings to ground faults based on actual experimental data. Finally, the proposed adaptive scheme is compared against other available non-adaptive protection schemes currently used in industrial relays. Several important performance evaluation criteria in protection schemes such as sensitivity and security of operation referred to as reliability are considered. It is shown that the adaptive scheme offers higher reliability than other schemes which emphasizes its credibility and applicability."

Many significant theorems and properties of the FrFT have been investigated and applied to many signal processing applications, most important among these are convolution, product and correlation theorems. Still many magnificent research works related to the conventional FrFT lacks the elegance and simplicity of the convolution, product and correlation theorems similar to the Euclidean Fourier transform (FT), which for convolution theorem states that the FT of the convolution of two functions is the product of their respective FTs.

We consider the output aquifer levels as the convolution between the input rain levels and the Water Residence Time, starting with an initial aquifer base level. The estimation of Water Residence Time is important for a better understanding of hydro-bio-geochemical processes and mixing properties of wetlands used as filters in ecological applications, as well as protecting fresh water sources for wells from pollutants. Common methods of estimating the Water Residence Time focus on cross-correlation, parameter fitting and non-parametric deconvolution methods. Here we propose a 1D full-deconvolution, regularized, non-parametric inverse problem algorithm that enforces smoothness and uses constraints of causality and positivity to estimate the Water Residence Time curve. Compared to Bayesian non-parametric deconvolution approaches, it has a fast runtime per test case; compared to the popular and fast cross-correlation method, it produces a more precise Water Residence Time curve even in the case of noisy measurements. The algorithm needs only one regularization parameter to balance between smoothness of the Water Residence Time and accuracy of the reconstruction.

Despite the great achievements of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness, modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in processing speech signals.  In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First, we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations. This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.  Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU, but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks, input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms, ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models."

From the results, we see the star interconnection is the optimal interconnection strategy when the BS are given the same number of measurements. On the other hand, the daisy chain interconnection outperforms the star interconnection when the same amount of time resources are consumed. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical analyses."
"arXiv:1803.01257","Xiao Fu, Kejun Huang, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos, Wing-Kin Ma","eess.SP","Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a workhorse for signal and data analytics, triggered by its model parsimony and interpretability. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining and hyperspectral imaging---had been rather limited until recent years. Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF, thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable factorization tools for their own problems."

The proposed hybrid measurement- and model-based method can accurately estimate the system state matrix in ambient conditions, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of which readily provide all the modal knowledge including frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes, and more importantly, participation factors. Numerical simulations show that the proposed technique is able to provide accurate estimation of modal knowledge for all modes. In addition, the discrepancy between the participation factor and the mode shape is shown through a numerical example, demonstrating that using the mode shape may not effectively pinpoint the best location for damping control. Therefore, the proposed technique capable of estimating participation factors may greatly facilitate designing damping controls."

The potential applications includes ranging from quantum physics, harmonic analysis, optical information processing, pattern recognition to varied allied areas of signal processing. Many significant theorems and properties of the FrFT have been investigated and applied to many signal processing applications, most important among these are convolution, product and correlation theorems. Still many magnificent research works related to the conventional FrFT lacks the elegance and simplicity of the convolution, product and correlation theorems similar to the Euclidean Fourier transform (FT), which for convolution theorem states that the FT of the convolution of two functions is the product of their respective FTs. The purpose of this paper is to devise the equivalent elegancy of convolution, product and correlation theorems, as in the case of Euclidean FT. Building on the seminal work of Pei et al. and the potential of the simplified fractional Fourier transform (SmFrFT), a detailed mathematical investigation is established to present an elegant definition of convolution, product and correlation theorems in the SmFrFT domain, along with their associated important properties. It has been shown that the established theorems along with their associated properties very nicely generalizes to the classical Euclidean FT."

We consider the output aquifer levels as the convolution between the input rain levels and the Water Residence Time, starting with an initial aquifer base level. The estimation of Water Residence Time is important for a better understanding of hydro-bio-geochemical processes and mixing properties of wetlands used as filters in ecological applications, as well as protecting fresh water sources for wells from pollutants. Common methods of estimating the Water Residence Time focus on cross-correlation, parameter fitting and non-parametric deconvolution methods. Here we propose a 1D full-deconvolution, regularized, non-parametric inverse problem algorithm that enforces smoothness and uses constraints of causality and positivity to estimate the Water Residence Time curve. Compared to Bayesian non-parametric deconvolution approaches, it has a fast runtime per test case; compared to the popular and fast cross-correlation method, it produces a more precise Water Residence Time curve even in the case of noisy measurements. The algorithm needs only one regularization parameter to balance between smoothness of the Water Residence Time and accuracy of the reconstruction. We propose an approach on how to automatically find a suitable value of the regularization parameter from the input data only. Tests on real data illustrate the potential of this method to analyze hydrological datasets."

"arXiv:1803.10225","Mirco Ravanelli, Philemon Brakel, Maurizio Omologo, Yoshua Bengio","eess.AS","A field that has directly benefited from the recent advances in deep learning is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness, modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in processing speech signals.  In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First, we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations. This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.  Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU, but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks, input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms, ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models."

This paper proposes a student-teacher learning paradigm for single channel speech enhancement. The beamformed signal from multichannel enhancement is given as input to the teacher network to obtain soft masks. An additional cross-entropy loss term with the soft mask target is combined with the original loss, so that the student network with single-channel input is trained to mimic the soft mask obtained with multichannel input through beamforming.

Under ideal conditions it has been shown that Aloha-NOMA, using power-domain orthogonality, can significantly increase the throughput using SIC (Successive Interference Cancellation) to enable correct reception of multiple simultaneous transmitted signals. For this ideal performance, the enhanced Aloha-NOMA receiver adaptively learns the number of active devices (which is not known a priori) using a form of multi-hypothesis testing.

The 4-port circulator is built upon a recently reported frequency-independent, programmable, non-reciprocal framework based on switched delay lines. The design space for such a system, including the origins of the insertion loss and harmonic responses, is theoretically investigated, illustrating that the key to better performance and low-cost modulation signal synthesis lies in a large delay. To implement a large delay, we resort to in-house fabricated low-loss, wide-band lithium niobate (LiNbO3) SH0 mode acoustic delay lines employing single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDT). The 4-port circulator, consisting of two switch modules and one delay line module, has been modularly designed, assembled, and tested. The design process employs time-domain full circuit simulation and the results match well with measurements. A 18.8 dB non-reciprocal contrast between insertion loss (IL = 6.6 dB) and isolation (25.4 dB) has been achieved over a fractional bandwidth of 8.8% at a center frequency 155 MHz, using a record low switching frequency of 877.19 kHz. The circulator also shows 25.9 dB suppression for the intra-modulated tone and 30 dBm for IIP3.

CRAN enables cloud centralized resource and power allocation optimization over all the small cells served by multiple Access Points (APs). However, the fronthaul links connecting each AP to the cloud introduce delays and cause outdated Channel State Information (CSI). By contrast, FogRAN enables lower latencies and better CSI qualities, at the cost of local optimization. To alleviate these issues, we propose a hybrid algorithm exploiting both the centralized feature of the cloud for globally-optimized pre-scheduling using outdated CSIs and the distributed nature of FogRAN for accurate beamforming with high quality CSIs. The centralized phase enables to consider the interference patterns over the global network, while the distributed phase allows for latency reduction. Simulation results show that our hybrid algorithm for FogRAN outperforms the centralized algorithm under imperfect CSI, both in terms of throughput and delays."

"arXiv:1802.05119","Jacques Naude, Ivan Hofsajer","eess.SP","Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM) has been successfully applied in power electronics for nearly 30 years. The effects of the various possible RPWM strategies on the Power Spectral Density have been thoroughly studied. Despite the effectiveness of RPWM in spreading harmonic content, an appeal is consistently made to maintain the textbook Pulse Width Modulation scheme 'on average'. Random Switching (RS) does away with this notion and probabilistically operates the switch. In addition to fulfilling several optimality conditions, including being the only viable switching strategy at the theoretical limit of performance and having lower switching losses than any other RPWM; RS allows for design of the DC behaviour separately from that of the PSD. The pulse amplitude probability affects the DC and total PSD. The first and second moment of the pulse length probability distribution affects the shape of the envelope of the noise of the PSD. The minimum pulse length acts like a selective harmonic filter. The PSD can therefore be shaped without external filtering by changing these probabilities. Gaussian and Huffman pulse length probabilities are shown to be good choices depending on whether real-time PSD control or spectrum usage are the design goal. In addition, it is shown that Cúk's state space averaging model applies to RS, with $D \to p$, hence no new tools are needed to understand the low frequency behavior or control performance. A benefit of closed loop random switching is that no filtering of the controlled variable is required. Randomly responding in a biased manner dependent on the error is hence shown to be useful. There are several good reasons to consider RS for high performance applications."

In this paper, we explore signal representation and recovery based on uniform amplitude sampling with assumed infinite precision timing information. The approach is based on the delta-ramp encoder which consists of applying a one-level level-crossing detector to the result of adding an appropriate sawtooth-like waveform to the input signal. The output samples are the time instants of these level crossings, thus representing a time-encoded version of the input signal. For theoretical purposes, this system can be equivalently analyzed by reversibly transforming through ramp addition a nonmonotonic input signal into a monotonic one which is then uniformly sampled in amplitude. The monotonic function is then represented by the times at which the signal crosses a predefined and equally-spaced set of amplitude values. We refer to this technique as amplitude sampling. The time sequence generated can be interpreted alternatively as nonuniform time sampling of the original source signal. We derive duality and frequency-domain properties for the functions involved in the transformation. Iterative algorithms are proposed and implemented for recovery of the original source signal. As indicated in the simulations, the proposed iterative amplitude-sampling algorithm achieves a faster convergence rate than frame-based reconstruction for nonuniform sampling. The performance can also be improved by appropriate choice of the parameters while maintaining the same sampling density."

A new causal bidirectional information (CBI) measure is defined as an improvement over standard directed information measures for the purposes of identifying connectivity between ROIs in a generalized cortical network setting.

"arXiv:1802.08591","Katsuyuki Haneda, Mikko Heino, Jan Järveläinen","eess.SP","This paper studies a gain of an antenna array embedded on a mobile device operating at a millimeter-wave radio frequency. Assuming that mobile phones at millimeter-wave range operate with a single baseband unit and analog beamforming like phased arrays, we define a total array gain denoting a path gain of the phased antenna array in excess to the omni-directional path gain. The total array gain circumvents the ambiguity of conventional array gain which cannot be uniquely defined as there are multiple choices of a reference single-element antenna in an array. Two types of 8-element patch antenna arrays implemented on a mobile phone chassis, i.e., uniform linear array (ULA) and distributed array (DA) both operating at 60 GHz, are studied. The gain evaluated in a small-cell scenario in an airport shows that DA achieves higher median and outage gain by up to 8 and 6 dB than ULA when different orientations of the mobile phone are considered along with body torso and finger shadowing. There are always postures of the mobile phone where ULA cannot see the line-of-sight due to directionality of the patch antenna and of body and finger shadowing, leading to outage gain of -15 dB in the worst case. The DA has much smaller variation of the gain across different orientations of the phone, even when the human torso shadowing and user's finger effects are considered."

However, in some systems, such as molecular communication systems where chemical signals are used for transfer of information, the underlying channel models are unknown. In these scenarios, a completely new approach to design and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by using tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that perform well without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We propose a technique we call sliding bidirectional recurrent neural network (SBRNN) for real-time sequence detection. We evaluate this algorithm using experimental data that is collected by a chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and difficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform significantly better than a detector proposed in previous works, and the SBRNN outperforms other techniques considered in this work."

Parallel combination of FSO and RF links and use of an access point, will increase capacity, reliability and data rate of the system. It is the first time that the effect of number of users on the performance of a dual-hop relay-assisted hybrid parallel FSO / RF system is investigated. FSO link is considered in Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence with the effect of pointing error and RF link is considered in Rayleigh fading. For the first time, closed-form expressions are derived for Bit Error Rate (BER) and Outage Probability (P_out) of the proposed system. Derived expressions are verified through MATLAB simulations. It is shown that the performance of the proposed system is almost independent of atmospheric turbulence intensity, thereby when atmospheric turbulence strengthens, low power consumption is required for maintenance of the system performance. Hence the proposed structure is particularly suitable for mobile communication systems in which a small mobile battery supplies transmitter power. Also the proposed system performance of the system is preferable even at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, proposed structure significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining performance of the system."
"arXiv:1802.07257","Matthias Rauter, Daniel Winkler","eess.IV","Gravitational mass flows, such as avalanches, debris flows and rockfalls are common events in alpine regions with high impact on transport routes. Within the last few decades, hazard zone maps have been developed to systematically approach this threat. These maps mark vulnerable zones in habitable areas to allow effective planning of hazard mitigation measures and development of settlements. Hazard zone maps have shown to be an effective tool to reduce fatalities during extreme events. They are created in a complex process, based on experience, empirical models, physical simulations and historical data. The generation of such maps is therefore expensive and limited to crucially important regions, e.g. permanently inhabited areas.  In this work we interpret the task of hazard zone mapping as a classification problem. Every point in a specific area has to be classified according to its vulnerability. On a regional scale this leads to a segmentation problem, where the total area has to be divided in the respective hazard zones. The recent developments in artificial intelligence, namely convolutional neuronal networks, have led to major improvement in a very similar task, image classification and semantic segmentation, i.e. computer vision. We use a convolutional neuronal network to identify terrain formations with the potential for catastrophic snow avalanches and label points in their reach as vulnerable. Repeating this procedure for all points allows us to generate an artificial hazard zone map. We demonstrate that the approach is feasible and promising based on the hazard zone map of the Tirolean Oberland. However, more training data and further improvement of the method is required before such techniques can be applied reliably."

Among many RDH approaches is prediction-error expansion (PEE), containing two steps: i) prediction of a target pixel value, and ii) embedding according to the value of prediction-error. In general, higher prediction performance leads to larger embedding capacity and/or lower signal distortion. Leveraging on recent advances in graph signal processing (GSP), we pose pixel prediction as a graph-signal restoration problem, where the appropriate edge weights of the underlying graph are computed using a similar patch searched in a semi-local neighborhood. Specifically, for each candidate patch, we first examine eigenvalues of its structure tensor to estimate its local smoothness. If sufficiently smooth, we pose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem using either a quadratic Laplacian regularizer or a graph total variation (GTV) term as signal prior. While the MAP problem using the first prior has a closed-form solution, we design an efficient algorithm for the second prior using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with nested proximal gradient descent. Experimental results show that with better quality GSP-based prediction, at low capacity the visual quality of the embedded image exceeds state-of-the-art methods noticeably."

This paper studies a multiple-input single-output NOMA CR network relying on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) conceived for supporting a massive population of power limited battery-driven devices. In contrast to most of the existing works, which use an ideally linear energy harvesting model, this study applies a more practical non-linear energy harvesting model. In order to improve the security of the primary network, an artificial-noise-aided cooperative jamming scheme is proposed. The artificial-noise-aided beamforming design problems are investigated subject to the practical secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. Specifically, the transmission power minimization problems are formulated under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and the bounded CSI error model. The problems formulated are non-convex, hence they are challenging to solve. A pair of algorithms either using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or a cost function are proposed for solving these problems. Our simulation results show that the proposed cooperative jamming scheme succeeds in establishing secure communications and NOMA is capable of outperforming the conventional orthogonal multiple access in terms of its power efficiency.

Second harmonic imaging (SHI) provides many advantages over the conventional pulse-echo USI, such as enhanced axial and lateral resolutions. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a major problem in SHI. In this paper, Eigenspace-based minimum variance (EIBMV) beamformer has been employed for second harmonic USI. The Tissue Harmonic Imaging (THI) is achieved by Pulse Inversion (PI) technique. Using the EIBMV weights, instead of the MV ones, would lead to reduced sidelobes and improved contrast, without compromising the high resolution of the MV beamformer (even at the presence of a strong noise). In addition, we have investigated the effects of variations of the important parameters in computing EIBMV weights, i.e., K, L, and δ, on the resolution and contrast obtained in SHI.

This enables the evaluation of the impact of inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) on the optical Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, the frequency dependent fiber attenuation can be taken into account and transmission systems that use hybrid amplification schemes can be modeled, where distributed Raman amplification is partly applied over the optical spectrum. To include the latter two cases, a set of coupled ordinary differential equations must be numerically solved in order to obtain the signal power profile yielding a semi-analytical model. However for lumped amplification and negligible variation in fiber attenuation, a less complex and fully analytical model is presented which is referred to as the ISRS GN model. The derived model is exact to first-order for Gaussian modulated signals and extensively validated by numerical split-step simulations. A maximum deviation of $0.1$~dB in nonlinear interference power between simulations and the ISRS GN model is found. The model is applied to a transmission system that occupies an optical bandwidth of $10$~THz, representing the entire C+L band. At optimum launch power, changes of up to $2$~dB in nonlinear interference power due to ISRS are reported.

Artifact detection plays an important role in the observation and analysis of EEG signals. Spatial information contained in the placement of the electrodes can be exploited to accurately detect artifacts. However, when fewer electrodes are used, less spatial information is available, making it harder to detect artifacts. In this study, we investigate the performance of a deep learning algorithm, CNN-LSTM, on several channel configurations. Each configuration was designed to minimize the amount of spatial information lost compared to a standard 22-channel EEG. Systems using a reduced number of channels ranging from 8 to 20 achieved sensitivities between 33% and 37% with false alarms in the range of [38, 50] per 24 hours. False alarms increased dramatically (e.g., over 300 per 24 hours) when the number of channels was further reduced. Baseline performance of a system that used all 22 channels was 39% sensitivity with 23 false alarms. Since the 22-channel system was the only system that included referential channels, the rapid increase in the false alarm rate as the number of channels was reduced underscores the importance of retaining referential channels for artifact reduction. This cautionary result is important because one of the biggest differences between various types of EEGs administered is the type of referential channel used."

Different from the stationary setting where the eigenvectors can be obtained directly from the covariance matrix of the observations, here we need to estimate first the unknown diffusion (graph) filter -- a polynomial in the GSO that preserves the sought eigenbasis. To carry out this initial system identification step, we exploit different sources of information on the arbitrarily-correlated input signal driving the diffusion on the graph.

This is achieved by employing a windowing technique and a voting-based frequency decoding procedure; the former reduces the frequency leakage of the off-grid frequencies below the noise level to preserve the sparsity of the signal, while the latter significantly lowers the frequency localization error stemming from the noise.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a noncoherent compressive channel estimation technique which can estimate a sparse spatial channel based on received signal strength (RSS) alone, and is compatible with off-the-shelf hardware. The approach is based on cascading phase retrieval (i.e., recovery of complex-valued measurements from RSS measurements, up to a scalar multiple) with coherent compressive estimation. While a conventional cascade scheme would multiply two measurement matrices to obtain an overall matrix whose entries are in a continuum, a key novelty in our scheme is that we constrain the overall measurement matrix to be implementable using coarsely quantized pseudorandom phases, employing a virtual decomposition of the matrix into a product of measurement matrices for phase retrieval and compressive estimation. Theoretical and simulation results show that our noncoherent method scales almost as well with array size as its coherent counterpart, thus inheriting the scalability and low overhead of the latter."

Delay Multiply and Sum (DMAS) was introduced to address this problem. However, the reconstructed images using DMAS still suffer from level of sidelobes and low noise suppression. In this paper, a novel beamforming algorithm is introduced based on the expansion of DMAS formula. It is shown that there is a DAS algebra inside the expansion, and it is proposed to use DMAS instead of the DAS algebra. The introduced method, namely Double Stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), is evaluated numerically and experimentally. The quantitative results indicate that DS-DMAS results in about 25% lower level of sidelobes compared to DMAS. Moreover, the introduced method leads to 23%, 22% and 43% improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Full-Width-Half-Maximum and Contrast Ratio, respectively, in comparison with DMAS beamformer."

Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming algorithm in PAI. However, using DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images and considerable contribution of off-axis signals. A new paradigm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS), which was originally used as a reconstruction algorithm in confocal microwave imaging, was introduced to overcome the challenges in DAS. DMAS was used in PAI systems and it was shown that this algorithm results in resolution improvement and sidelobe degrading. However, DMAS is still sensitive to high levels of noise, and resolution improvement is not satisfying. Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on DAS algebra inside DMAS formula expansion, Double Stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), which improves the image resolution and levels of sidelobe, and is much less sensitive to high level of noise compared to DMAS. The performance of DS-DMAS algorithm is evaluated numerically and experimentally. The resulted images are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using established quality metrics including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and contrast ratio (CR). It is shown that DS-DMAS outperforms DAS and DMAS at the expense of higher computational load. DS-DMAS reduces the lateral valley for about 15 dB and improves the SNR and FWHM better than 13% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the levels of sidelobe are reduced for about 10 dB in comparison with those in DMAS."

The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, heterogeneity of devices, and susceptibility to cyber-physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and information dissemination in the presence of adversaries.

Starting with a multilayer network corresponding to a delocalized PEV, we rewire the network edges using an optimization technique such that the PEV of the rewired multilayer network becomes more localized. The framework allows us to scrutinize structural and spectral properties of the networks at various localization points during the rewiring process. We show that rewiring only one-layer is enough to attain a multilayer network having a highly localized PEV. Our investigation reveals that a single edge rewiring of the optimized multilayer network can lead to the complete delocalization of a highly localized PEV. This sensitivity in the localization behavior of PEV is accompanied by a pair of almost degenerate eigenvalues. This observation opens an avenue to gain a deeper insight into the origin of PEV localization of networks. Furthermore, analysis of multilayer networks constructed using real-world social and biological data show that the localization properties of these real-world multilayer networks are in good agreement with the simulation results for the model multilayer network.

Several algorithmic approaches proposed for IA aim to minimize the leakage interference at each receiver to attain perfect alignment. However, the non-orthogonality of signal and interference space limits sum rate performance, even if the interference is perfectly aligned. In this paper, we propose that by using reconfigurable antennas and an adaptive switching technique, an effective channel can be selected in order to maximize the sum rate and the distance between the two subspaces. We first formulate the channel selection as a multi-armed problem that aims to optimize the sum rate of the network. We show that by using an adaptive sequential learning policy, each node in the network can learn to select optimal channels without requiring full and instantaneous CSI for all the available antenna states.

"arXiv:1712.05457","Christopher Slezak, Aditya Dhananjay, Sundeep Rangan","eess.SP","The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies offer the potential for enormous capacity wireless links. However, designing robust communication systems at these frequencies requires that we understand the channel dynamics over both time and space: mmWave signals are extremely vulnerable to blocking and the channel can thus rapidly appear and disappear with small movement of obstacles and reflectors. In rich scattering environments, different paths may experience different blocking trajectories and understanding these multi-path blocking dynamics is essential for developing and assessing beamforming and beam-tracking algorithms. This paper presents the design and experimental results of a novel measurement system which uses phased arrays to perform mmWave dynamic channel measurements. Specifically, human blockage and its effects across multiple paths are investigated with only several microseconds between successive measurements. From these measurements we develop a modeling technique which uses low-rank tensor factorization to separate the available paths so that their joint statistics can be understood."

The traditional MUSIC-based algorithms can estimate either the DOA and polarization for circular signal or the DOA for non-circular signal by using spectrum search. By contrast, in the proposed algorithm only the DOA estimation needs spectrum search, and the polarization estimation has a closedform expression. First, a novel dimension-reduced MUSIC (DRMUSIC) is proposed for DOA and polarization estimation of circular signal with low computational complexity. Next, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation of non-circular signal with high estimation accuracy. Then based on the DOA estimation result using QNC-MUSIC, the polarization estimation of non-circular signal is acquired by using the closed-form expression of the polarization estimation in DR-MUSIC. In addition, the computational complexity analysis shows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation algorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC and DRMUSIC have much lower computational complexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization parameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve the parameter estimation performance when the large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed."

To address this question, resting EEG power and coherence were assessed in 40 clinically high-risk individuals (CHR), 40 first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES), and 40 healthy controls (HC).

We embed the radar functionality within standards-compliant operations that do not modify the core structure of the frames beyond what is defined by the 802.11ad protocol. This not only reduces the beam training time, but also ensures scalability with increasing vehicular traffic because radar allows accurate ranging of up to 0.1m at distances up to 200m. We further analyze the ensuing cost-benefit trade-off between the time allotted to the proposed in-band radar and communication modes. Our results reveal 83% reduction on the overhead incurred during the beam training achieved for a specific simulated vehicular scenario over the classical 802.11ad operation."

Our proposed Adaptive Nonlinear Differential Limiter (ANDL) is constructed from a linear analog filter by applying a feedback-based nonlinearity, controlled by a single resolution parameter. We present a simple practical method to find the value of this resolution parameter that ensures the mitigation of impulsive without impacting the desired OFDM signal. Unlike many prior approaches for impulsive noise mitigation that assume a statistical noise model, ANDL is blind to the exact nature of the noise distribution, and is designed to be fully compatible with existing linear front end filters. We demonstrate the potency of ANDL by simulating the OFDM-based narrowband PLC compliant with the IEEE standards. We show that the proposed ANDL outperforms other approaches in reducing the BER in impulsive noise environments."

Although spatial regularizers which promote smoothness of the abundance maps have been widely used, they may overly smooth these maps and, in particular, may not preserve edges present in the hyperspectral image. Existing unmixing methods usually ignore these edge structures or use edge information derived from the hyperspectral image itself. However, this information may be affected by large amounts of noise or variations in illumination, leading to erroneous spatial information incorporated into the unmixing procedure. This paper proposes a simple, yet powerful, spectral unmixing framework which incorporates external data (i.e. LiDAR data). The LiDAR measurements can be easily exploited to adjust standard spatial regularizations applied to the unmixing process. The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated using two simulated datasets and a real hyperspectral image.

Conventionally, minimum phase HRTF model development for reconstruction of HRTFs has been limited to minimum phase-pure delay models which ignore the all pass component of the HRTF. In this paper, a novel method for minimum phase HRTF modelling of Pinna Spectral Notches (PSNs) using group delay decomposition is proposed. The proposed model captures the PSNs contributed by both the minimum phase and all pass component of HRTF thus facilitating an accurate reconstruction of HRTFs. The purely minimum phase HRTF components and their corresponding spatial angles are first identified using Fourier Bessel Series method that ensures a continuous evolution of the PSNs. The minimum phase-pure delay model is used to reconstruct HRTF for these spatial angles. Subsequently, the spatial angles which require both the minimum phase and all pass components are modelled using an all-pass filter cascaded with minimum-phase pure-delay model. Performance of the proposed model is evaluated by conducting experiments on PSN extraction, cross coherence analysis, and binaural synthesis. Both objective and subjective evaluation results are used to indicate the significance of the proposed model in binaural sound synthesis."

Unlike existing methods like Capon or MUSIC which can be considered as single source approximations of multi-source estimation criteria, the proposed approach accounts for the existence of multiple sources. At each considered direction, the manifold structure of the remaining interfering signals impinging on the sensor array is relaxed, which results in closed form estimates for the interference parameters. The conventional multidimensional optimization problem reduces, thanks to this relaxation, to a simple spectral search. Following this principle, we propose estimators based on the Deterministic Maximum Likelihood, Weighted Subspace Fitting and covariance fitting methods. To calculate the pseudo-spectra efficiently, an iterative rooting scheme based on the rational function approximation is applied to the partial relaxation methods. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed estimators is superior to the conventional methods especially in the case of low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio and low number of snapshots, irrespectively of any specific structure of the sensor array while maintaining a comparable computational cost as MUSIC."

The logarithm of the squared norm of the Fourier transform was plotted against the squared distance from the origin. Linear correlations were observed in the logarithmic plots, indicating that the PSF of the test images can be approximated with a Gaussian. The MTF was then calculated from the Gaussian-approximated PSF. The obtained MTF closely coincided with the MTF predicted from the original PSF.

With this study, it was possible to observe that when there is a restriction regarding the initial condition, the results present aspects with significant differences of the ones found in the literature regarding the behaviour of the map, consequently there is a considerable modification in its bifurcation diagram.

The CRN framework can analyze the time-sensitive signal data close to the signal source using fog computing with different types of machine learning techniques. Depending on the computational capabilities of the fog nodes, different features and machine learning techniques are chosen to optimize spectrum allocation. Also, the computing nodes send the periodic signal summary which is much smaller than the original signal to the cloud so that the overall system spectrum source allocation strategies are dynamically updated. Applying fog computing, the system is more adaptive to the local environment and robust to spectrum changes. As most of the signal data is processed at the fog level, it further strengthens the system security by reducing the communication burden of the communications network."

We derive a closed-form expression for the KL principal component, which is easy to compute and has an intuitive probabilistic interpretation. For generalized KL approximation with higher ranks, the problem is for the first time shown to be equivalent to multinomial latent variable modeling, and an iterative algorithm is derived that resembles the expectation-maximization algorithm.

This problem is commonly addressed by acquiring a speech signal from multiple microphones and performing beamforming over them. In this paper, we propose to use a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to adaptively estimate real-time beamforming filter coefficients to cope with non-stationary environmental noise and dynamic nature of source and microphones positions which results in a set of timevarying room impulse responses. The LSTM adaptive beamformer is jointly trained with a deep LSTM acoustic model to predict senone labels.

The advantage of the SDR approach includes: a re-configurable design, adaptive response to changing conditions, efficient development, and highly versatile implementation. In order to understand the benefits of SDR, the space telecommunication radio system (STRS) was proposed by NASA Glenn research center (GRC) along with the standard application program interface (API) structure. Each component of the system uses a well-defined API to communicate with other components. The benefit of standard API is to relax the platform limitation of each component for addition options. For example, the waveform generating process can support a field programmable gate array (FPGA), personal computer (PC), or an embedded system. As long as the API defines the requirements, the generated waveform selection will work with the complete system. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and development of adaptive SDR following the STRS and standard API protocol. We introduce step by step the SDR testbed system including the controlling graphic user interface (GUI), database, GNU radio hardware control, and universal software radio peripheral (USRP) tranceiving front end. In addition, a performance evaluation in shown on the effectiveness of the SDR approach for space telecommunication."

Language adaptation, in contrast to speaker adaptation, needs to be applied not only on the feature level, but also to deeper layers of the network. In this work, we therefore extended our previous approach by introducing a novel technique which we call "modulation". Based on this method, we modulated the hidden layers of RNNs using LFVs.

In this paper, we are interested in counting the total number of people walking inside a building (or in general behind walls), using readily-deployable WiFi transceivers that are installed outside the building, and only based on WiFi RSSI measurements. The key observation of the paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to the dip events of the received signal, are fairly robust to the attenuation through walls (for instance as compared to the exact dip values). We then propose a methodology that can extract the total number of people from the inter-event times. More specifically, we first show how to characterize the wireless received power measurements as a superposition of renewal-type processes. By borrowing theories from the renewal-process literature, we then show how the probability mass function of the inter-event times carries vital information on the number of people. We validate our framework with 44 experiments in five different areas on our campus (3 classrooms, a conference room, and a hallway), using only one WiFi transmitter and receiver installed outside of the building, and for up to and including 20 people. Our experiments further include areas with different wall materials, such as concrete, plaster, and wood, to validate the robustness of the proposed approach.

Our approach not only enables speed estimation in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions. More specifically, we use a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose RSSI measurements are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this region, but also in adjacent WiFi-free regions. We first prove how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing the two links implicitly carry key information about the pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical model to relate them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with 108 experiments, in both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10 people walk in two adjacent areas, with variety of speeds per region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate these speeds with only a pair of WiFi links in one region. For instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. We also evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting and estimate the popularity of different exhibits.

We propose a novel filter-type equalizer to improve the solution of the linear minimum-mean squared-error (LMMSE) turbo equalizer, with computational complexity constrained to be quadratic in the filter length. When high-order modulations and/or large memory channels are used the optimal BCJR equalizer is unavailable, due to its computational complexity. In this scenario, the filter-type LMMSE turbo equalization exhibits a good performance compared to other approximations. In this paper, we show that this solution can be significantly improved by using expectation propagation (EP) in the estimation of the a posteriori probabilities. First, it yields a more accurate estimation of the extrinsic distribution to be sent to the channel decoder. Second, compared to other solutions based on EP the computational complexity of the proposed solution is constrained to be quadratic in the length of the finite impulse response (FIR). In addition, we review previous EP-based turbo equalization implementations. Instead of considering default uniform priors we exploit the outputs of the decoder. Some simulation results are included to show that this new EP-based filter remarkably outperforms the turbo approach of previous versions of the EP algorithm and also improves the LMMSE solution, with and without turbo equalization."

"arXiv:1711.09375","Khanh Quoc Dinh, Thuong Nguyen Canh, Byeungwoo Jeon","eess.IV","This paper addresses an ill-posed problem of recovering a color image from its compressively sensed measurement data. Differently from the typical 1D vector-based approach of the state-of-the-art methods, we exploit the nonlocal similarities inherently existing in images by treating each patch of a color image as a 3D tensor consisting of not only horizontal and vertical but also spectral dimensions. A group of nonlocal similar patches form a 4D tensor for which a nonlocal higher order dictionary is learned via higher order singular value decomposition. The multiple sub-dictionaries contained in the higher order dictionary decorrelate the group in each corresponding dimension, thus help the detail of color images to be reconstructed better. Furthermore, we promote sparsity of the final solution using a sparsity regularization based on a weight tensor. It can distinguish those coefficients of the sparse representation generated by the higher order dictionary which are expected to have large magnitude from the others in the optimization. Accordingly, in the iterative solution, it acts like a weighting process which is designed by approximating the minimum mean squared error filter for more faithful recovery. Experimental results confirm improvement by the proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones."

In such an environment the noise source might evolve, causing the stationary models to fail. Therefore a heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model is introduced where the variance can vary across observations and sensors. The source amplitudes are assumed independent zero-mean complex Gaussian distributed with unknown variances (i.e. the source powers), inspiring stochastic maximum likelihood DOA estimation. The DOAs of plane waves are estimated from multi-snapshot sensor array data using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) where the noise is estimated across both sensors and snapshots. This SBL approach is more flexible and performs better than high-resolution methods since they cannot estimate the heteroscedastic noise process. An alternative to SBL is simple data normalization, whereby only the phase across the array is utilized. Simulations demonstrate that taking the heteroscedastic noise into account improves DOA estimation."

Moreover, the base station transfers power to the nodes by using Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) to extend their battery life. However, inadequately scheduling WPT and data collection causes some of the nodes to drain their battery and have their data buffer overflow, while the other nodes waste their harvested energy, which is more than they need to transmit their packets. In this paper, we investigate a novel optimal scheduling strategy, called EHMDP, aiming to minimize data packet loss from a network of sensor nodes in terms of the nodes' energy consumption and data queue state information. The scheduling problem is first formulated by a centralized MDP model, assuming that the complete states of each node are well known by the base station. This presents the upper bound of the data that can be collected in a rechargeable wireless sensor network. Next, we relax the assumption of the availability of full state information so that the data transmission and WPT can be semi-decentralized.

Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the sound and static pressure loss measured at the trachea of a miniature pig airway tree model based on the geometric details extracted from physical measurements. Methods: In the current study, static pressure loss and sound generation measured in the trachea was documented at different flow rates of a miniature pig airway tree. Results: Results showed that the static pressure and the amplitude of the recorded sound at the trachea increased as the flow rate increased. The dominant frequency was found to be around 1840-1870 Hz for flow rates of 0.2-0.55 lit/s.

Prescriptive notations offer generic guidelines for a raga rendition and do not include information about the ornamentations or the gamakas, which are considered to be critical for characterizing a raga. In this paper, we show that prescriptive notations contain raga attributes and can reliably identify a raga of Carnatic music from its octave-folded prescriptive notations. We restrict the notations to 7 notes and suppress the finer note position information. A dictionary based approach captures the statistics of repetitive note patterns within a raga notation. The proposed stochastic models of repetitive note patterns (or SMRNP in short) obtained from raga notations of known compositions, outperforms the state of the art melody based raga identification technique on an equivalent melodic data corresponding to the same compositions. This in turn shows that for Carnatic music, the note transitions and movements have a greater role in defining the raga structure than the exact note positions."

A central challenge when dealing with many demand response providers is the uncertainty of its realization. In this paper, a new economic dispatch framework that is based on the recent theoretical development of the scenario approach is introduced. By removing samples from a finite uncertainty set, this approach improves dispatch performance while guaranteeing a quantifiable risk level with respect to the probability of violating the constraints. The theoretical bound on the level of risk is shown to be a function of the number of scenarios removed. This is appealing to the system operator for the following reasons: (1) the improvement of performance comes at the cost of a quantifiable level of violation probability in the constraints; (2) the violation upper bound does not depend on the probability distribution assumption of the uncertainty in demand response. Numerical simulations on (1) 3-bus and (2) IEEE 14-bus system (3) IEEE 118-bus system suggest that this approach could be a promising alternative in future electricity markets with multiple demand response providers."

The study is focused on the investigation of various building materials each having a different roughness, at a central frequency of 60GHz. Very large signal strength variations in first order scattered components is observed as the user moves over very short distances. This is due to the small-scale fading caused by rough surface scatterers. Furthermore, it is shown that the diffused scattering depends on the material roughness, the angle of incidence and the distance from the surface. Finally, results indicate that reflections from rough materials may suffer from high depolarization, a phenomenon that can potentially be exploited in order to improve the performance of mm-Wave systems using polarization diversity."

"arXiv:1710.06043","Shuyan Hu, Chongbin Xu, Xin Wang, Yongwei Huang, Shunqing Zhang","eess.SP","The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) has facilitated efficient and sustainable resource allocation for wireless communication systems. In this paper, a novel framework is introduced to develop coordinated multicell beamforming (CMBF) design for wireless cellular networks powered by a smart microgrid, where the BSs are equipped with RES harvesting devices and can perform two-way (i.e., buying/selling) energy trading with the main grid. To this end, new models are put forth to account for the stochastic RES harvesting, two-way energy trading, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based energy transaction cost. Capitalizing on these models, we propose a distributed CMBF solution to minimize the grid-wide transaction cost subject to user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, relying on state-of-the-art optimization tools, we show that the relevant task can be formulated as a convex problem that is well suited for development of a distributed solver. To cope with stochastic availability of the RES, the stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then leveraged to develop a novel distributed CMBF scheme. It is established that the proposed scheme is guaranteed to yield the optimal CMBF solution, with only local channel state information available at each BS and limited information exchange among the BSs. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the merits of the proposed scheme."

When extended to graph signal processing (GSP), this would mean that a shift-invariant graph filter can be represented as a polynomial of the adjacency (shift) matrix of the graph. However, the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the adjacency matrix must be identical for the property to hold. While it has been suggested that this condition might be ignored as it is always possible to find a polynomial transform to represent the original adjacency matrix by another adjacency matrix that satisfies the condition, this letter shows that a filter that is shift invariant in terms of the original graph may not be shift invariant anymore under the modified graph and vice versa. We introduce the notion of "shift-enabled graph" for graphs that satisfy the aforementioned condition, and present a concrete example of a graph that is not "shift-enabled" and a shift-invariant filter that is not a polynomial of the shift operation matrix. The result provides a deeper understanding of shift-invariant filters when applied in GSP and shows that further investigation of shift-enabled graphs is needed to make it applicable to practical scenarios."

In particular, the common problem of estimating the value of a vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements is at the core of a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and sonar, biomedicine, image processing, and seismology, just to name a few. Developing an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the measured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct, fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements. Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present. Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further, understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical literature in the last fifty years.

Convolution neural network can be used to meet the challenge, but it often requires a large number of computation resources. In this paper, a computation-efficient convolutional module, named SdcBlock, is proposed and based on it, the convolution network SdcNet is introduced for object recognition tasks. In the proposed module, optimized successive depthwise convolutions supported by appropriate data management is applied in order to generate vectors containing high density and more varieties of feature information. The hyperparameters can be easily adjusted to suit varieties of tasks under different computation restrictions without significantly jeopardizing the performance. The experiments have shown that SdcNet achieved an error rate of 5.60% in CIFAR-10 with only 55M Flops and also reduced further the error rate to 5.24% using a moderate volume of 103M Flops. The expected computation efficiency of the SdcNet has been confirmed."
"arXiv:1805.02852","Sundaresh Ram, Mert R. Sabuncu","eess.IV","Supervised image segmentation assigns image voxels to a set of labels, as defined by a specific labeling protocol. In this paper, we decompose segmentation into two steps. The first step is what we call "primitive segmentation", where voxels that form sub-parts (primitives) of the various segmentation labels available in the training data, are grouped together. The second step involves computing a protocol-specific label map based on the primitive segmentation. Our core contribution is a novel loss function for the first step, where a primitive segmentation model is trained. The proposed loss function is the entropy of the (protocol-specific) "ground truth" label map conditioned on the primitive segmentation. The conditional entropy loss enables combining training datasets that have been manually labeled with different protocols. Furthermore, as we show empirically, it facilitates an efficient strategy for transfer learning via a lightweight protocol adaptation model that can be trained with little manually labeled data. We apply the proposed approach to the volumetric segmentation of brain MRI scans, where we achieve promising results."

In this paper we discuss a system that learns from scratch from user demonstrations. This method has the advantage that the same system can be used for many domains and users without modifications and that no training data is required prior to deployment. The user is required to train the system, so for a user friendly experience it is crucial to minimize the required amount of data. In this paper we investigate whether a capsule network can make efficient use of the limited amount of available training data. We compare the proposed model to an approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorisation which is the state-of-the-art in this setting and another deep learning approach that was recently introduced for end-to-end spoken language understanding. We show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models for three command-and-control applications: controlling a small robot, a vocally guided card game and a home automation task."

Compared with other popular FEC codes, polar codes decoded by list successive cancellation decoding (LSCD) with a large list size have better error correction performance. However, due to the serial decoding nature of LSCD and the high complexity of list management (LM), the decoding latency is high, which limits the usage of polar codes in practical applications that require low latency and high throughput. In this work, we study the high-throughput implementation of LSCD with a large list size. Specifically, at the algorithmic level, to achieve a low decoding latency with moderate hardware complexity, two decoding schemes, a multi-bit double thresholding scheme and a partial G-node look-ahead scheme, are proposed. Then, a high-throughput VLSI architecture implementing the proposed algorithms is developed with optimizations on different computation modules. From the implementation results on UMC 90 nm CMOS technology, the proposed architecture achieves decoding throughputs of 1.103 Gbps, 977 Mbps and 827 Mbps when the list sizes are 8, 16 and 32, respectively."

Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) sub-frame configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macro cell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on uplink transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per-user grows infinitely large.

This study explores new forms of regularization by adding unsupervised auxiliary tasks to reconstruct hidden layer representations. This auxiliary task requires the denoising of hidden representations at every layer of an auto-encoder. The framework relies on ladder networks that utilize skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to learn powerful representations of emotional dimensions. The results show that ladder networks improve the performance of the system compared to baselines that individually learn each attribute, and conventional denoising autoencoders. Furthermore, the unsupervised auxiliary tasks have promising potential to be used in a semi-supervised setting, where few labeled sentences are available."

However, despite its popularity, very little is known about the representation capacity of this model. In this paper, we study how redundant a dictionary must be so as to allow any vector to admit a sparse approximation with a prescribed sparsity and a prescribed level of accuracy. We address this problem both in a worst-case setting and in an average-case one. For each scenario we derive lower and upper bounds on the minimal required overcompleteness. Our bounds have simple closed-form expressions that allow to easily deduce the asymptotic behavior in large dimensions. In particular, we find that the required overcompleteness grows exponentially with the sparsity level and polynomially with the allowed representation error. This implies that universal sparse representation is practical only at moderate sparsity levels, but can be achieved at relatively high accuracy. As a side effect of our analysis, we obtain a tight lower bound on the regularized incomplete beta function, which may be interesting in its own right. We illustrate the validity of our results through numerical simulations, which support our findings."

This alignment of spoken behavior has important implications for conversational success. However, modeling the subtle nature of entrainment in spoken dialogue continues to pose a challenge. In this paper, we propose a straightforward definition for local entrainment in the speech domain and operationalize an algorithm based on this: acoustic-prosodic features that capture entrainment should be maximally different between real conversations involving two partners and sham conversations generated by randomly mixing the speaking turns from the original two conversational partners. We propose an approach for measuring local entrainment that quantifies alignment of behavior on a turn-by-turn basis, projecting the differences between interlocutors' acoustic-prosodic features for a given turn onto a discriminative feature subspace that maximizes the difference between real and sham conversations. We evaluate the method using the derived features to drive a classifier aiming to predict an objective measure of conversational success (i.e., low versus high), on a corpus of task-oriented conversations.

"arXiv:1804.00290","Jiacen Zhang, Nakamasa Inoue, Koichi Shinoda","eess.AS","I-vector based text-independent speaker verification (SV) systems often have poor performance with short utterances, as the biased phonetic distribution in a short utterance makes the extracted i-vector unreliable. This paper proposes an i-vector compensation method using a generative adversarial network (GAN), where its generator network is trained to generate a compensated i-vector from a short-utterance i-vector and its discriminator network is trained to determine whether an i-vector is generated by the generator or the one extracted from a long utterance. Additionally, we assign two other learning tasks to the GAN to stabilize its training and to make the generated ivector more speaker-specific. Speaker verification experiments on the NIST SRE 2008 "10sec-10sec" condition show that our method reduced the equal error rate by 11.3% from the conventional i-vector and PLDA system."

In contrast to common myopic policies, who use one step ahead prediction, MPNC predicts the future behavior of the system for an extended horizon, thus facilitating performance gains. We define an advanced system model in which we use a Markov chain in combination with a Bernoulli trial to model the stochastic components of the network. Furthermore we introduce the algorithm and present two detailed simulation examples, which show general improved performance and a gain in stability region compared to the standard policy."
"arXiv:1804.00037","Alireza Partovi, Jin Dai, Hai Lin","eess.SP","Traditional supervisory control theory of discrete-event systems mainly deals with closed systems, and only ensures correct behaviors that can be generated by the system under certain environments that have been captured by the plant model. However, such control methods cannot be applied for many industrial systems nowadays since they are open systems and their behaviors heavily depend on nontrivial interactions with external environments. The key challenge on the control of these open systems is due to the need of the correctness guarantee with respect to all possible environments, which are dynamic, uncertain and sometimes unpredictable. In this paper, we are motivated to extend the conventional DES supervisory control theory to open DESs. Specifically, we consider control objectives that characterize the input-output behaviors of such an open system, and propose a game-theoretic approach to design a reactive supervisor in order to meet the specifications regardless of the external environment behaviors. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a reactive supervisor is provided and illustrative examples are given throughout the paper to explain the key definitions and the effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic supervisor design method."

Recent works based on compression models have shown that these approaches are suitable to ECG biometric identification. However, the best results are usually achieved by the methods that, at least, rely on one point of interest of the ECG.  In this work, we propose a compression-based non-fiducial method, that uses a measure of similarity, called the Normalized Relative Compression -- a measure related to the Kolmogorov complexity of strings. Our method uses extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCMs) on the quantized first-order derivative of the signal, instead of using directly the original signal, as other methods do.  We were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a database collected at the University of Aveiro, which was used on previous works, making it a good preliminary benchmark for the method."

Cipriano, Charly Poulliat, Marie-Laure Boucheret","eess.SP","This paper investigates the design and analysis of minimum mean square error (MMSE) turbo decision feedback equalization (DFE), with expectation propagation (EP), for single carrier modulations. Classical non iterative DFE structures have substantial advantages at high data rates, even compared to turbo linear equalizers - interference cancellers (LE-IC), hence making turbo DFE-IC schemes an attractive solution. In this paper, we derive an iterative DFE-IC, capitalizing on the use of soft feedback based on expectation propagation, along with the use of prior information for improved filtering and interference cancellation. This DFE-IC significantly outperforms exact turbo LE-IC, especially at high spectral efficiency, and also exhibits various advantages and performance improvements over existing variants of DFE-IC. The proposed scheme can also be self-iterated, as done in the recent trend on EP-based equalizers, and it is shown to be an attractive alternative to linear self-iterated receivers. For time-varying (TV) filter equalizers, an efficient matrix inversion scheme is also proposed, considerably reducing the computational complexity relative to existing methods. Using finite-length and asymptotic analysis on a severely selective channel, the proposed DFE-IC is shown to achieve higher rates than known alternatives, with better waterfall thresholds and faster convergence, while keeping a similar computational complexity."

We demonstrate how these integrity indices can be used to study the dynamic behavior of the power system. Furthermore, a comparison analysis is conducted between the synchronization coefficient (KS) and the generator rotor angle correlation coefficient (CC). The proposed indices demonstrate the dynamic behavior of power system following occurrence the faults and thus represent a promising approach in power system islanding studies.

Ritcey","eess.SP","Due to the publicly-known deterministic character- istic of pilot tones, pilot-aware attack, by jamming, nulling and spoofing pilot tones, can significantly paralyze the uplink channel training in large-scale MISO-OFDM systems. To solve this, we in this paper develop an independence-checking coding based (ICCB) uplink training architecture for one-ring scattering scenarios allowing for uniform linear arrays (ULA) deployment. Here, we not only insert randomized pilots on subcarriers for channel impulse response (CIR) estimation, but also diversify and encode subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) to convey those pilots simultaneously. The coded SAPs, though interfered by arbitrary unknown SAPs in wireless environment, are qualified to be reliably identified and decoded into the original pilots by checking the hidden channel independence existing in subcarri- ers. Specifically, an independence-checking coding (ICC) theory is formulated to support the encoding/decoding process in this architecture. The optimal ICC code is further developed for guaranteeing a well-imposed estimation of CIR while maximizing the code rate. Based on this code, the identification error probability (IEP) is characterized to evaluate the reliability of this architecture. Interestingly, we discover the principle of IEP reduction by exploiting the array spatial correlation, and prove that zero-IEP, i.e., perfect reliability, can be guaranteed under continuously-distributed mean angle of arrival (AoA). Besides this, a novel closed form of IEP expression is derived in discretely- distributed case. Simulation results finally verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture."

In this paper, we model those complex and irregular data as piecewise-smooth graph signals and propose a graph dictionary to effectively represent those graph signals. We first propose the graph multiresolution analysis, which provides a principle to design good representations. We then propose a coarse-to-fine approach, which iteratively partitions a graph into two subgraphs until we reach individual nodes. This approach efficiently implements the graph multiresolution analysis and the induced graph dictionary promotes sparse representations piecewise-smooth graph signals. Finally, we validate the proposed graph dictionary on two tasks: approximation and localization. The empirical results show that the proposed graph dictionary outperforms eight other representation methods on six datasets, including traffic networks, social networks and point cloud meshes."

Sparse sampling schemes are ideally suited for such applications where the images can be reconstructed from a sparse set of measurements. In particular, dynamic sparse sampling based on supervised learning has shown promising results for practical applications. However, a particular drawback of such methods is that it requires training image sets with similar information content which may not always be available. In this paper, we introduce a Supervised Learning Approach for Dynamic Sampling (SLADS) algorithm that uses a deep neural network based training approach. We call this algorithm SLADS- Net. We have performed simulated experiments for dynamic sampling using SLADS-Net in which the training images either have similar information content or completely different information content, when compared to the testing images. We compare the performance across various methods for training such as least- squares, support vector regression and deep neural networks. From these results we observe that deep neural network based training results in superior performance when the training and testing images are not similar. We also discuss the development of a pre-trained SLADS-Net that uses generic images for training. Here, the neural network parameters are pre-trained so that users can directly apply SLADS-Net for imaging experiments."

In this paper, linear networks (LN) is inserted in multiple neural network layers and fine-tuned together with output layer for best speaker adaptation performance. When adaptation data is extremely small, the low-rank plus diagonal(LRPD) decomposition for LN is employed to make the adapted voice more stable. Speaker adaptation experiments are conducted under a range of adaptation utterances numbers. Moreover, speaker adaptation from 1) female to female, 2) male to female and 3) female to male are investigated. Objective measurement and subjective tests show that LN with LRPD decomposition performs most stable when adaptation data is extremely limited, and our best speaker adaptation (SA) model with only 200 adaptation utterances achieves comparable quality with speaker dependent (SD) model trained with 1000 utterances, in both naturalness and similarity to target speaker."

One fundamental problem in GSP is sampling---from which subset of graph nodes to collect samples in order to reconstruct a bandlimited graph signal in high fidelity. In this paper, we seek a sampling strategy that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed bandlimited graph signals assuming an independent and identically distributed (iid) noise model---leading naturally to the A-optimal design criterion. To avoid matrix inversion, we first prove that the inverse of the information matrix in the A-optimal criterion is equivalent to a Neumann matrix series. We then transform the truncated Neumann series based sampling problem into an equivalent expression that replaces eigenvectors of the Laplacian operator with a sub-matrix of an ideal low-pass graph filter. Finally, we approximate the ideal filter using a Chebyshev matrix polynomial. We design a greedy algorithm to iteratively minimize the simplified objective. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied signal reconstruction strategy that reuses the approximated filter sub-matrix and is provably more robust than conventional least square recovery. Simulation results show that our sampling strategy outperforms two previous strategies in MSE performance at comparable complexity."
"arXiv:1803.04550","Fernando Gama, Alejandro Ribeiro","eess.SP","For stationary signals in time the weak law of large numbers (WLLN) states that ensemble and realization averages are within e of each other with a probability of order O(1/Ne^2) when considering N signal components. The graph WLLN introduced in this paper shows that the same is essentially true for signals supported on graphs. However, the notions of stationarity, ensemble mean, and realization mean are different. Recent papers have defined graph stationary signals as those that satisfy a form of invariance with respect to graph diffusion. The ensemble mean of a graph stationary signal is not a constant but a node-varying signal whose structure depends on the spectral properties of the graph. The realization average of a graph signal is defined here as an average of successive weighted averages of local signal values with signal values of neighboring nodes. The graph WLLN shows that this two node-varying signals are within e of each other with probability of order O(1/Ne^2) in at least some nodes. In stationary time signals, the realization average is not only a consistent estimator of the ensemble mean but also optimal in terms of mean squared error (MSE). This is not true of graph signals. Optimal MSE graph filter designs are also presented. An example problem concerning the estimation of the mean of a Gaussian random field is presented."

Notwithstanding, the complex networks originated by locally measuring EEG and BOLD are often treated as isolated networks and do not capture the dependency from external stimuli, e.g., originated in subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the brain stem. Therefore, we propose a paradigm-shift towards the analysis of such complex networks under unknown unknowns (i.e., excitations).

This analysis can be seen as a generalization of results obtained for wireless communication. The features of the diagonal elements of the wireline channel matrices make wireless asymptotic analyses inapplicable for wireline systems. Further, direct application of results from random matrix theory (RMT) yields a trivial lower bound. This paper presents a novel approach to asymptotic analysis, where an alternative sequence of systems is constructed that includes the system of interest in order to approximate the spectral efficiency of the linear zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) crosstalk cancelers. Using works in the field of large dimensional random matrices, we show that the user rate in this sequence converges to a non-zero rate. The approximation of the user rate for both the ZF and MMSE cancelers are very simple to evaluate and does not need to take specific channel realizations into account. The analysis reveals the intricate behavior of the throughput as a function of the transmission power and the channel crosstalk. This unique behavior has not been observed for linear decoders in other systems. The approximation presented here is much more useful for the next generation G.fast wireline system than earlier digital subscriber line (DSL) systems as previously computed performance bounds, which are strictly larger than zero only at low frequencies. We also provide a numerical performance analysis over measured and simulated DSL channels which show that the approximation is accurate even for relatively low dimensional systems and is useful for many scenarios in practical DSL systems."

The basic underlying concept of MIMO is to exploit the signal and channel characteristics to eliminate interference between multiple transmissions. Departing from the work carried out under the industrial projects \cite{NGW,Henarejos}, we extend the results provided in their respective reports. The goal is to increase the SE without an increment of radiated energy without any Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) and feedback at the transmitter and maintaining a very low computational complexity at the receiver. Although a priori additional power is required to increase the SE, we demonstrate that the proposed Polarized Modulation (PMod) scheme exploits the polarization diversity reducing the required EbN0 and adding an extra bit. We also introduce two receivers to demodulate this scheme of different computational complexities. We describe a Near Optimal Detector (NOD) which achieves almost the same performance as the optimal detector based on the Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD), but with lower computational complexity.

We have previously derived GLRTs for these specific scenarios; here, we examine the existence of LMPITs. We show that these exist only for detecting the presence of a cyclostationary signal in spatially uncorrelated noise. For white noise, an LMPIT does not exist. Instead, we propose tests that approximate the LMPIT, and they are shown to perform well in simulations. Finally, if the noise structure is not known in advance, we also present hypothesis tests using our framework."

Regular vine copula is an extremely flexible and powerful graphical model to characterize complex dependence among multiple modalities. It can express a multivariate copula by using a cascade of bivariate copulas, the so-called pair copulas. Assuming that local detectors are single threshold binary quantizers and taking complex dependence among sensor decisions into account, we design an optimal fusion rule using a regular vine copula under the Neyman-Pearson framework. In order to reduce the com- putational complexity resulting from the complex dependence, we propose an efficient and computationally light regular vine copula based optimal fusion algorithm.

Automatic detection of epileptic seizures can considerably improve the patients' quality of life. Current Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection systems encounter many challenges in real-life situations. The EEGs are non-stationary signals and seizure patterns vary across patients and recording sessions. Moreover, EEG data are prone to numerous noise types that negatively affect the detection accuracy of epileptic seizures. To address these challenges, we introduce the use of a deep learning-based approach that automatically learns the discriminative EEG features of epileptic seizures. Specifically, to reveal the correlation between successive data samples, the time-series EEG data are first segmented into a sequence of non-overlapping epochs. Second, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to learn the high-level representations of the normal and the seizure EEG patterns. Third, these representations are fed into Softmax function for training and classification. The results on a well-known benchmark clinical dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be robust in noisy and real-life conditions. Compared to current methods that are quite sensitive to noise, the proposed method maintains its high detection performance in the presence of common EEG artifacts (muscle activities and eye-blinking) as well as white noise."

The fundamental ideas of the proposed frameworks are to exploit the asymptotic structure of channel matrix using random matrix theory for linear analysis and to use convex optimization for non-linear analysis. Specially, using Bussgang's theorem, the quantized signal output is decomposed into a linear function of the input to the quantizers and an uncorrelated distortion term. Based on this linear model, the unknown parameters in the linear function are then determined using random matrix theory without assuming perfect statistics of CSI. Besides, motivated by seeking robust solution for quantized MU-MIMO with higher-order modulation, we develop semidefinite programming (SDP) based non-linear analysis which significantly outperforms the methods proposed in linear analysis in terms of bit error rate performance. Furthermore, a low complexity suboptimal solver is also provided. The case studies illustrate and verify the superiority of proposed algorithms."

Significant and consistent improvements in the error rate of the reconstructed symbols, compared to constant modulus equalizers, are demonstrated. In fact, for the channels that were examined, the performance of the new VAE blind channel equalizer was close to the performance of a nonblind adaptive linear minimum mean square error equalizer. The new equalization method enables a significantly lower latency channel acquisition compared to the constant modulus algorithm (CMA). The VAE uses a convolutional neural network with two layers and a very small number of free parameters. Although the computational complexity of the new equalizer is higher compared to CMA, it is still reasonable, and the number of free parameters to estimate is small."

An intuitive idea is to factorize each speech frame into individual informative factors, though it turns out to be highly difficult. Recently, we found that speaker traits, which were assumed to be long-term distributional properties, are actually short-time patterns, and can be learned by a carefully designed deep neural network (DNN). This discovery motivated a cascade deep factorization (CDF) framework that will be presented in this paper. The proposed framework infers speech factors in a sequential way, where factors previously inferred are used as conditional variables when inferring other factors. We will show that this approach can effectively factorize speech signals, and using these factors, the original speech spectrum can be recovered with a high accuracy. This factorization and reconstruction approach provides potential values for many speech processing tasks, e.g., speaker recognition and emotion recognition, as will be demonstrated in the paper."

Considering an existing assumption in which an eavesdropper is also a part of network, a proactive relay selection by the eavesdropper is proposed. The best relay which maximizes the eavesdropping rate is selected by the eavesdropper. A relay selection scheme is also proposed to improve the secrecy of the system by minimizing the eavesdropping rate. Performances of these schemes are compared with two passive eavesdropping scenarios in which the eavesdropper performs selection and maximal ratio combining on the relayed links. A realistic channel model with independent non-identical links between nodes and direct links from the source to both the destination and eavesdropper are assumed. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of these schemes in Rayleigh fading channel are obtained. It is shown that the relay selection by the proactive eavesdropper is most detrimental to the system as not only the SOP increases with the increase in the number of relays, but its diversity also remains unchanged."

Each participant's subjective experience was measured directly through questionnaire and indirectly by examining peripheral physiological changes, change in facial expressions and the number of head nods and shakes they made as they listened to each mix. We showed that music production quality had more of an emotional impact on critical listeners.

Its performance is characterized by the state evolution (SE) which is a simple scalar recursion. However, depending on a measurement matrix ensemble, AMP may face a convergence problem. To avoid this problem, orthogonal AMP (OAMP), which uses de-correlation linear estimation and divergence-free non-linear estimation, was proposed by Ma and Ping. They also provide the SE analysis for OAMP. In their SE analysis, the following two assumptions were made: (i) The estimated vector of the de-correlation linear estimator consists of i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian entries independent of the vector to be estimated and (ii) the estimated vector of the divergence-free non-linear estimator consists of i.i.d. entries independent of the measurement matrix and the noise vector.

First, the proposed least mean squares (LMS) based algorithm is developed for the training mode and then is extended for the blind mode of the operation by combining with the decision direction (DD) or adaptive Bussgang algorithm (ABA) techniques. In the blind mode, because of decision errors, a smaller step size is considered for the LMS algorithm and the channel estimation is run a few times to improve its precision. In each round of the estimation in the blind mode, the step size is decreased to form some kind of annealing. Both DD LMS and ABA LMS techniques are simulated and compared to the full training case and MSE of channel estimation error is considered as comparison criterion. It is shown for 2x4 DD LMS and for 4x4 ABA LMS algorithms present near full training case estimation error.

A powerful approach in this category of restoration algorithms is the popular Expected Patch Log-likelihood (EPLL) algorithm. EPLL uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior learned on clean image patches as a way to regularize degraded patches. In this paper, we show that a generalized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM) captures the underlying distribution of patches better than a GMM. Even though GGMM is a powerful prior to combine with EPLL, the non-Gaussianity of its components presents major challenges to be applied to a computationally intensive process of image restoration. Specifically, each patch has to undergo a patch classification step and a shrinkage step. These two steps can be efficiently solved with a GMM prior but are computationally impractical when using a GGMM prior. In this paper, we provide approximations and computational recipes for fast evaluation of these two steps, so that EPLL can embed a GGMM prior on an image with more than tens of thousands of patches. Our main contribution is to analyze the accuracy of our approximations based on thorough theoretical analysis. Our evaluations indicate that the GGMM prior is consistently a better fit for modeling image patch distribution and performs better on average in image denoising task."
"arXiv:1802.01464","Malcolm Woolfson","eess.SP","A blind source separation method is described to extract sources from data mixtures where the underlying sources are assumed to be sparse and uncorrelated.

This combined information can then be used to estimate the sources one at a time using a deflationary method. Probability density functions are not assumed for any of the sources. A comparison is made between the proposed method, the Minimum Heading Change method, Fast-ICA and Clusterwise PCA. It is shown, for the dataset used in this paper, that the proposed method has the best performance for clean signals if the input parameters are chosen correctly.

In non-cooperative approaches, positioning is only based on information from reference nodes with known positions (anchors). However, in cooperative positioning, information from other agents is considered as well. Cooperative positioning requires encoding of the uncertainty of agents' positions. To cope with that demand, we employ stochastic inference for localization which inherently considers the position uncertainty of agents. However, stochastic inference comes at the expense of high costs in terms of computation and information exchange. To relax the requirements of inference algorithms, we propose the framework of position-constrained stochastic inference, in which we first confine the positions of nodes to feasible sets. We use convex polygons to impose constraints on the possible positions of agents. By doing so, we enable inference algorithms to concentrate on important regions of the sample space rather than the entire sample space. We show through simulations that increased localization accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and quicker convergence can be achieved when compared to a state-of-the-art non-constrained inference algorithm."

However, these systems are often vulnerable to ambient magnetic distortions and lack useful position information; in the absence of external position aiding (e.g. satellite/ultra-wideband positioning systems) the dead-reckoned position accuracy from a 9-DoF MEMS IMU deteriorates rapidly due to unmodelled errors. Positioning information is valuable in many satellite-denied geomatics applications (e.g. indoor navigation, location-based services, etc.). This paper proposes an improved 9-DoF IMU indoor pose tracking method using batch optimization. By adopting a robust in-situ user self-calibration approach to model the systematic errors of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer simultaneously in a tightly-coupled post-processed least-squares framework, the accuracy of the estimated trajectory from a 9-DoF MEMS IMU can be improved. Through a combination of relative magnetic measurement updates and a robust weight function, the method is able to tolerate a high level of magnetic distortions. The proposed auto-calibration method was tested in-use under various heterogeneous magnetic field conditions to mimic a person walking with the sensor in their pocket, a person checking their phone, and a person walking with a smartwatch. In these experiments, the presented algorithm improved the in-situ dead-reckoning orientation accuracy by 79.8 - 89.5% and the dead-reckoned positioning accuracy by 72.9 - 92.8%, thus reducing the relative positioning error from metre-level to decimetre-level after ten seconds of integration, without making assumptions about the user's dynamics."

In this paper, the offline dual-channel frequency domain TRINICON implementation for sparsely mixed signals is investigated, and a multi-source activity detection is proposed to locate the active period of each source, based on which the filter updating strategy is regularized to improve the separation performance. The objective metric provided by the BSSEVAL toolkit is utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme."
"arXiv:1802.09036","Chunping Qiu, Michael Schmitt, Xiao Xiang Zhu","eess.IV","In this paper we discuss the potential and challenges regarding SAR-optical stereogrammetry for urban areas, using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. Since we do this mainly from a geometrical point of view, we first analyze the height reconstruction accuracy to be expected for different stereogrammetric configurations. Then, we propose a strategy for simultaneous tie point matching and 3D reconstruction, which exploits an epipolar-like search window constraint. To drive the matching and ensure some robustness, we combine different established handcrafted similarity measures. For the experiments, we use real test data acquired by the Worldview-2, TerraSAR-X and MEMPHIS sensors. Our results show that SAR-optical stereogrammetry using VHR imagery is generally feasible with 3D positioning accuracies in the meter-domain, although the matching of these strongly hetereogeneous multi-sensor data remains very challenging.

"arXiv:1802.08053","Luciano da F. Costa","eess.SP","The effects of reactive loads into amplification is studied. A simplified common emitter circuit configuration was adopted and respective time-independent and time-dependent voltage and current equations were obtained. As phasor analysis cannot be used because of the non-linearity, the voltage at the capacitor was represented in terms of the respective integral, implying a numerical approach. The effect of purely resistive loads was investigated first, and it was shown that the fanned structure of the transistor isolines can severely distort the amplification, especially for $V_a$ small and $s$ large. The total harmonic distortion was found not to depend on $V_a$, being determined by $s$ and the load resistance $R$. An expression was obtained for the current gain in terms of the base current and it was shown that it decreases in an almost perfectly linearly fashion with $I_B$. Remarkably, no gain variation, and hence perfectly linear amplification, is obtained when $R=0$, provided maximum power dissipation limits are not exceeded. Capacitive loads imply the detachment of the circuit trajectory from a straight line to an "ellipsoidal"-like loop. This implies a gain asymmetry along upper or lower arcs of this loop. By using the time-dependent circuit equations, it was possible to show numerically and by an analytical approximation that, at least for the adopted circuit and parameter values, the asymmetry induced by capacitive loads is not substantial. However, capacitive loads will imply lag between the output voltage and current and, hence, low-pass filtering. It was shown that smaller $V_a$ and larger $s$ can substantially reduce the phase lag, but at the cost of severe distortion."

However, time consuming of the data-acquisition process is a critical issue. In this paper, we make an analysis on the FPM imaging system with half number of the captured images. Based on the image analysis of the conventional FPM system, we then compare the reconstructed images with different number of captured data. Simulation and experiment results show that the reconstructed image with half number captured data do not show obvious resolution degradation compared to that with all the captured data, except a contrast reduction. In particular in the case when the object is close to phase-only/amplitude only, the quality of the reconstructed image with half of the captured data is nearly as good as the one reconstructed with full data."

Exploiting the characteristics of massive antenna array, a spatial-temporal basis expansion model is designed to reduce the effective dimensions of up-link and down-link channel, which decomposes channel state information into the time-varying spatial information and gain information. We firstly model the users movements as a one-order unknown Markov process, which is blindly learned by the expectation and maximization (EM) approach. Then, the up-link time varying spatial information can be blindly tracked by Taylor series expansion of the steering vector, while the rest up-link channel gain information can be trained by only a few pilot symbols. Due to angle reciprocity (spatial reciprocity), the spatial information of the down-link channel can be immediately obtained from the up-link counterpart, which greatly reduces the complexity of down-link channel tracking. Various numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In a previous work, we introduced an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network that uses music emotion classification as a surrogate task for music highlight extraction, for Pop songs. The rationale behind that approach is that the highlight of a song is usually the most emotional part. This paper extends our previous work in the following two aspects. First, methodology-wise we experiment with a new architecture that does not need any recurrent layers, making the training process faster. Moreover, we compare a late-fusion variant and an early-fusion variant to study which one better exploits the attention mechanism. Second, we conduct and report an extensive set of experiments comparing the proposed attention-based methods against a heuristic energy-based method, a structural repetition-based method, and a few other simple feature-based methods for this task. Due to the lack of public-domain labeled data for highlight extraction, following our previous work we use the RWC POP 100-song data set to evaluate how the detected highlights overlap with any chorus sections of the songs.

We focus on the scenario where the local user has a number of independent tasks that can be executed in parallel but cannot be further partitioned. We consider a time division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol, in which the local user can offload computation tasks to the helpers and download results from them over pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup, we minimize the local user's computation latency by optimizing the task assignment jointly with the time and power allocations, subject to individual energy constraints at the local user and the helpers. However, the joint task assignment and wireless resource allocation problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) that is hard to solve optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first relax it into a convex problem, and then propose an efficient suboptimal solution based on the optimal solution to the relaxed convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed joint design significantly reduces the local user's computation latency, as compared against other benchmark schemes that design the task assignment separately from the offloading/downloading resource allocations and local execution."
"arXiv:1802.06929","Subhash Joshi T. G., Vinod John","eess.SP","Many high voltage applications are realized with series connected thyristors. Voltage imbalance among series connected thyristors during steady state as well as in transients is one of the major concerns. This voltage imbalance is mitigated by using static and dynamic balancing network. Dynamic balancing networks are typically designed based on reverse recovery charge of the thyristor during turn-off, which suits many applications. But this is not the case for a crowbar application, where turn-off of the thyristor is not a major circuit constraint. This paper proposes the design method for dynamic balancing network considering gate turn-on delay time and the balancing network component tolerances. The paper derives two models for the dynamic balancing network based on its charge-discharge cycle. The importance of charge-discharge cycle in the design of dynamic balancing network during high di/dt operation is emphasized. Influence of dynamic balancing resistance and crowbar current limiting inductance on voltage imbalance, charging current and discharging current is studied using the analytical model. The proposed design method also offers flexibility to incorporate differences in propagation delays among the thyristor drivers that are used to trigger individual thyristors. Such delays cannot be directly incorporated in the conventional balancing network design method based on reverse recovery. Further, it is also analytically shown that designing the dynamic balancing network based on reverse recovery charge makes the balancing network lossy and bulky for crowbar application. Simulation studies and experimental results on a 12kV , 1kA crowbar consisting of six series connected thyristors confirms the theoretical analysis and validates the proposed approach for crowbar applications."

During the past decades, several techniques have been suggested to estimate the tissue elasticity by measuring the displacement of the Carotid vessel wall. Cross correlation-based methods are the most prevalent approaches to measure the strain exerted in the wall vessel by the blood pressure. In the case of a low pressure, the displacement is too small to be apparent in ultrasound imaging, especially in the regions far from the center of the vessel, causing a high error of displacement measurement. On the other hand, increasing the compression leads to a relatively large displacement in the regions near the center, which reduces the performance of the cross correlation-based methods. In this study, a non-rigid image registration-based technique is proposed to measure the tissue displacement for a relatively large compression. The results show that the error of the displacement measurement obtained by the proposed method is reduced by increasing the amount of compression while the error of the cross correlationbased method rises for a relatively large compression. We also used the synthetic aperture imaging method, benefiting the directivity diagram, to improve the image quality, especially in the superficial regions. The best relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed method and the adaptive cross correlation method were 4.5% and 6%, respectively. Consequently, the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional method and reduces the relative RMSE by 25%."

Existing transmission strategies in an RF-based energy harvesting system is mainly based on a classic model, in which the data transmission is scheduled in a fixed feasible energy tunnel. In this paper, we re-examine the classic energy harvesting model and show through the theoretical analysis and experimental results that the bounds of feasible energy tunnel are dynamic, which can be affected by the transmission scheduling due to the impact of residual energy on the harvested one. To describe a practical energy harvesting process more accurately, a new model is proposed by adding a feedback loop that reflects the interplay between the energy harvest and the data transmission. Furthermore, to improve network performance, we revisit the design of an optimal transmission scheduling strategy based on the new model. To handle the challenge of the endless feedback loop in the new model, a recursive algorithm is developed. The simulation results reveal that the new transmission scheduling strategy can balance the efficiency of energy reception and energy utilization regardless of the length of energy packets, achieving improved throughput performance for wireless communications."

Prince","eess.IV","High resolution magnetic resonance~(MR) imaging~(MRI) is desirable in many clinical applications, however, there is a trade-off between resolution, speed of acquisition, and noise. It is common for MR images to have worse through-plane resolution~(slice thickness) than in-plane resolution. In these MRI images, high frequency information in the through-plane direction is not acquired, and cannot be resolved through interpolation. To address this issue, super-resolution methods have been developed to enhance spatial resolution. As an ill-posed problem, state-of-the-art super-resolution methods rely on the presence of external/training atlases to learn the transform from low resolution~(LR) images to high resolution~(HR) images. For several reasons, such HR atlas images are often not available for MRI sequences. This paper presents a self super-resolution~(SSR) algorithm, which does not use any external atlas images, yet can still resolve HR images only reliant on the acquired LR image. We use a blurred version of the input image to create training data for a state-of-the-art super-resolution deep network. The trained network is applied to the original input image to estimate the HR image. Our SSR result shows a significant improvement on through-plane resolution compared to competing SSR methods."

The proposed approach uses theorems by Girko that analytically produce deterministic approximations of the empirical spectral distribution for suitable non-Hermitian random matrices. The approximate empirical spectral distribution defines filtering regions in the proposed filter optimization problem, which must be modified to accommodate complex-valued eigenvalues.

The motivation behind our work is to offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging prices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is incorporated in the model. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) --- are applied to derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the multiobjective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP algorithm can achieve up to 7% profit gain over using greedy algorithm.

For each incident illumination pattern, all transmitted light is collected by a photon-counting bucket (single-pixel) detector. The transmission coefficients measured in this way are then used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the object's projected transmission. It is demonstrated that the squared spatial resolution of such a setup is usually equal to the ratio of the image area to the number of linearly independent illumination patterns. If the noise in the measured transmission coefficients is dominated by photon shot noise, then the ratio of the spatially-averaged squared mean signal to the spatially-averaged noise variance in the "flat" distribution reconstructed in the absence of the object, is equal to the average number of registered photons when the illumination patterns are orthogonal. The signal-to-noise ratio in a reconstructed transmission distribution is always lower in the case of non-orthogonal illumination patterns due to spatial correlations in the measured data. Examples of imaging methods relevant to the presented analysis include conventional imaging with a pixelated detector, computational ghost imaging, compressive sensing, super-resolution imaging and computed tomography."

Traditional WPT technologies face the challenge of providing Watt-level power over meter-level distance for Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices, such as sensors, controllers, smart-phones, laptops, etc.. Distributed laser charging (DLC), a new WPT alternative, has the potential to solve these problems and enable WPT with the similar experience as WiFi communications. In this paper, we present a multi-module DLC system model, in order to illustrate its physical fundamentals and mathematical formula. This analytical modeling enables the evaluation of power conversion or transmission for each individual module, considering the impacts of laser wavelength, transmission attenuation and photovoltaic-cell (PV-cell) temperature. Based on the linear approximation of electricity-to-laser and laser-to-electricity power conversion validated by measurement and simulation, we derive the maximum power transmission efficiency in closed-form. Thus, we demonstrate the variation of the maximum power transmission efficiency depending on the supply power at the transmitter, laser wavelength, transmission distance, and PV-cell temperature.

Therefore, this work not only provides the insight of DLC in theory, but also offers the guideline of DLC system design in practice."
"arXiv:1801.04131","Michael Karrenbauer, Andreas Weinand, Hans D. Schotten","eess.SP","Future wireless communications systems are expected to support multi-service operation, i.e. especially multi-rate as well as multi-level quality of service (QoS) requirements. This evolution is mainly driven by the success of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the growing presence of machine type communication (MTC). Whereas in the last years information in wireless communication systems was mainly generated or at least requested by humans and was also processed by humans, we can now see a paradigm shift since so-called machine type communication is gaining growing importance. Along with these changes we also encounter changes regarding the quality of service requirements, data rate requirements, latency constraints, different duty cycles et cetera. The challenge for new communication systems will therefore be to enable different user types and their different requirements efficiently. In this paper, we present partly overloaded spreading sequences, i.e. sequences which are globally orthogonal and sequences which interfere with a subset of sequences while being orthogonal to the globally orthogonal sequences. Additionally, we are able to vary the spreading factor of these sequences, which allows us to flexibly assign appropriate sequences to different service types or user types respectively. We propose the use of these sequences for a CDMA channel access method which is able to flexibly support different traffic types."

Also, coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission is utilized among multiple cells to serve users experiencing severe inter-cell interference (ICI). More specifically, we consider a two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) consisting of a high-power macro cell underlaid with multiple low-power small cells each of which uses the same resource block. Under this {\em CoMP-NOMA framework}, CoMP transmission is applied to a user experiencing high channel gain with multiple base stations (BSs)/cells, while NOMA is utilized to schedule CoMP and non-CoMP users over the same transmission resources, i.e., time, spectrum and space. Different CoMP-NOMA models are discussed, but focus is primarily on the joint transmission CoMP-NOMA (JT-CoMP-NOMA) model. For the JT-CoMP-NOMA model, an optimal joint power allocation problem is formulated and the solution is derived for each CoMP-set consisting of multiple cooperating BSs (i.e., CoMP BSs). To overcome the substantial computational complexity of the joint power optimization approach, we propose a distributed power optimization problem at each cooperating BS whose optimal solution is independent of the solution of other coordinating BSs. The validity of the distributed solution for the joint power optimization problem is provided and numerical performance evaluation is carried out for the proposed CoMP-NOMA models including JT-CoMP-NOMA and coordinated scheduling CoMP-NOMA (CS-CoMP-NOMA). The obtained results reveal significant gains in spectral and energy efficiency in comparison with conventional CoMP-orthogonal multiple access (CoMP-OMA) systems."

It is known, however, that people with unilateral hearing loss can also localize sounds. Monaural localization is possible thanks to the scattering by the head, though it hinges on learning the spectra of the various sources. We take inspiration from this human ability to propose algorithms for accurate sound source localization using a single microphone embedded in an arbitrary scattering structure. The structure modifies the frequency response of the microphone in a direction-dependent way giving each direction a signature. While knowing those signatures is sufficient to localize sources of white noise, localizing speech is much more challenging: it is an ill-posed inverse problem which we regularize by prior knowledge in the form of learned non-negative dictionaries. We demonstrate a monaural speech localization algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization that does not depend on sophisticated, designed scatterers. In fact, we show experimental results with ad hoc scatterers made of LEGO bricks. Even with these rudimentary structures we can accurately localize arbitrary speakers; that is, we do not need to learn the dictionary for the particular speaker to be localized. Finally, we discuss multi-source localization and the related limitations of our approach."

Since the manager of the MBS and the operators of the UAVs could be of different interest groups, we formulate the corresponding spectrum trading problem by means of contract theory, where the manager of the MBS has to design an optimal contract to maximize its own revenue. Such contract comprises a set of bandwidth options and corresponding prices, and each UAV operator only chooses the most profitable one from all the options in the whole contract. We analytically derive the optimal pricing strategy based on fixed bandwidth assignment, and then propose a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the optimal bandwidth assignment in polynomial time.

Therefore, the CC technique is one of the nominees for 5G networks. In the Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying scheme which is one of the CC techniques, determination of the threshold value at the relay has a key role for the system performance and power usage. In this paper, we propose prediction of the optimal threshold values for the best relay selection scheme in cooperative communications, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the first time in literature. The average link qualities and number of relays have been used as inputs in the prediction of optimal threshold values using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. The MLP network has better performance from the RBF network on the prediction of optimal threshold value when the same number of neurons is used at the hidden layer for both networks. Besides, the optimal threshold values obtained using ANNs are verified by the optimal threshold values obtained numerically using the closed form expression derived for the system. The results show that the optimal threshold values obtained by ANNs on the best relay selection scheme provide a minimum Bit-Error-Rate (BER) because of the reduction of the probability that error propagation may occur. Also, for the same BER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold values provides 2dB less power usage, which is great gain in terms of green communicationBER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold values provides 2dB less power usage, which is great gain in terms of green communication."

One key aspect of this process is the choice of the best modulation format. To this end, performance comparisons among several modulation formats against different physical constraints have been presented in literature and are still being carried out. In our contribution, we performed an exhaustive analysis on the impact of transceivers electrical frequency response shape on the performance of 2-levels pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-2), 4-levels PAM (PAM-4), electrical and optical duobinary modulation formats with adaptive equalizer at the receiver side. We show by means of numerical simulations that the specification of the typically used -3dB bandwidth is not sufficient, since also out-of-band electrical frequency response specifications (such as the -20dB bandwidth) has a huge impact on the performance of the analyzed modulation formats. The normalized graphs given at the end of the paper in terms of -3dB and -20 dB bandwidths can thus be useful for the design of the next generation of HS-PON transceivers."

In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of the effects of the image size reduction, due to a gradual decimation of the original image. Three different decimation procedures were implemented and their consequences on the discrete correlation functions and the coarseness are reported and analyzed. A normalization for each of the correlation functions has been performed. When the loss of statistical information has not been significant for a decimated image, its normalized correlation function is forecast by the trend of the original image. In contrast, when the decimated image does not represent the statistical evidence of the original one, the normalized correlation function diverts from the reference function. Moreover, the equally weighted sum of the average of the squared differences leads to a definition of an overall error. During the first stages of the gradual decimation, the error remains relatively small and independent of the decimation procedure. Above a threshold defined by the correlation length of the reference function, the error becomes a function of the number of decimation steps. At this stage, some statistical information is lost and the error becomes dependent of the decimation procedure. These results may help us to restrict the amount of information that one can afford to lose during a decimation process, in order to reduce the computational and memory cost, when one aims to diminish the time consumed by a characterization or reconstruction technique, yet maintaining the statistical quality of the digitized sample."

In direct comparison with the PD detector, the PD-ML detector exhibits improved classification accuracy when tested against an extensive library of recorded field data. In particular, it is (1) significantly more accurate at distinguishing a spoofing attack from a jamming attack, (2) better at distinguishing multipath-afflicted data from interference-free data, and (3) less likely to issue a false alarm by classifying multipath as spoofing.

However, time can bring forth new insights, since many real signals like sensor measurements, biological, financial, and network signals in general, have intrinsic correlations in both domains. In this work, we fill this lacuna by jointly considering the graph-time nature of graph signals, named graph processes for two main tasks: i) observability of graph processes; and ii) tracking of graph processes via Kalman filtering; both from a (possibly time-varying) subset of nodes. A detailed mathematical analysis ratifies the proposed methods and provides insights on the role played by the different actors, such as the graph topology, the process bandwidth and the sampling strategy. Moreover, (sub)optimal sampling strategies that jointly exploit the nature of the graph structure and graph process are proposed.

In this paper, we propose a correlation constrained missing-data estimation based blind multichannel frequency- domain least-mean-squares (md-bMCFLMS) algorithm to undo the effect of PSF on the ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data. In the first step, a block-based MCFLMS (bMCFLMS) algorithm is proposed to estimate the TRFs and the PSF which are used in the second step to estimate the missing data. This missing data is used in the md-bMCFLMS algorithm to construct a modified cost function for further improvement of the image resolution. To account for the nonstationarity of the PSF, unlike the blocking approach described in the literature, we introduce a time-efficient blocking method in this paper. The blocking approach described here uses a block position independent fixed size matrix and can be implemented parallely. The bMCFLMS algorithm, however, shows misconvergence due to both channel noise and propagation of TRF estimation error from the previous blocks. This phe- nomenon is more intense in the case of md-bMCFLMS algorithm because of increased estimation error. To address this problem, a novel constraint based on the correlation between the measured RF data and estimated TRF is proposed in this paper. The efficacy of our proposed blind deconvolution algorithm is measured using simulation phantom, experimental phantom and in-vivo data."

However, the compression of reciprocal space at high energies typically results in poorly resolved fringes on an area detector, rendering the diffraction data unsuitable for the three-dimensional reconstruction of compact crystals. To address this problem, we propose a method by which to recover fine fringe detail in the scattered intensity. This recovery is achieved in two steps: multiple undersampled measurements are made by in-plane sub-pixel motion of the area detector, then this data set is passed to a sparsity-based numerical solver that recovers fringe detail suitable for standard Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) reconstruction methods of compact single crystals. The key insight of this paper is that sparsity in a BCDI data set can be enforced by recognising that the signal in the detector, though poorly resolved, is band-limited. This requires fewer in-plane detector translations for complete signal recovery, while adhering to information theory limits. We use simulated BCDI data sets to demonstrate the approach, outline our sparse recovery strategy, and comment on future opportunities."

Predicting age and body mass index by actively profiling the gait samples, could be further used for providing suitable healthcare recommendations. Existing strategies for predicting age and body mass index, however, necessitate stringent experimental settings for achieving appropriate performance. For instance, precisely recorded speech signals were recently used for predicting body mass indices of different subjects.

"arXiv:1711.02832","Takafumi Okuda, Takashi Hikihara","eess.SP","In this paper, we investigated a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs."

PPG is affected by the capillary blood perfusion and the pumping function of the heart, which generally deteriorate with age and due to presence of cardiac arrhythmia. The performance of wrist PPG in monitoring beat-to-beat HR in older patients with arrhythmia has not been reported earlier. We monitored PPG from wrist in 18 patients recovering from surgery in the post anesthesia care unit, and evaluated the inter-beat interval (IBI) detection accuracy against ECG based R-to-R intervals (RRI). Nine subjects had sinus rhythm (SR, 68.0y$\pm$10.2y, 6 males) and nine subjects had atrial fibrillation (AF, 71.3y$\pm$7.8y, 4 males) during the recording. For the SR group, 99.44% of the beats were correctly identified, 2.39% extra beats were detected, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was 7.34 ms. For the AF group, 97.49% of the heartbeats were correctly identified, 2.26% extra beats were detected, and the MAE was 14.31 ms. IBI from the PPG were hence in close agreement with the ECG reference in both groups. The results suggest that wrist PPG provides a comfortable alternative to ECG and can be used for long-term monitoring and screening of AF episodes."

Whereas large training corpora are readily available for languages like English, there exists a long tail of languages which do suffer from a lack of resources. One method to handle data sparsity is to use data from additional source languages and build a multilingual system. Recently, ASR systems based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) have gained substantial research interest. In this work, we extended our previous approach towards training CTC-based systems multilingually. Our systems feature a global phone set, based on the joint phone sets of each source language. We evaluated the use of different language combinations as well as the addition of Language Feature Vectors (LFVs). As contrastive experiment, we built systems based on graphemes as well. Systems having a multilingual phone set are known to suffer in performance compared to their monolingual counterparts. With our proposed approach, we could reduce the gap between these mono- and multilingual setups, using either graphemes or phonemes."

Using synchrophasor measurements, a machine learning method is proposed to locate the source of forced oscillation in power systems. Rotor angle and active power of each power plant are utilized to construct multivariate time series (MTS). Applying Mahalanobis distance metric and dynamic time warping, the distance between MTS with different phases or lengths can be appropriately measured. The obtained distance metric, representing characteristics during the transient phase of forced oscillation under different disturbance sources, is used for offline classifier training and online matching to locate the disturbance source.

For instance, multiple measurements allow to infer the size of an object or to more precisely measure the object's motion. Yet, the increased amount of data raises the demands on tracking modules: measurement models that are able to process multiple measurements for an object are necessary and measurement-to-object associations become more complex. This paper presents a new variational radar model for vehicles and demonstrates how this model can be incorporated in a Random-Finite-Set-based multi-object tracker. The measurement model is learned from actual data using variational Gaussian mixtures and avoids excessive manual engineering. In combination with the multi-object tracker, the entire process chain from the raw measurements to the resulting tracks is formulated probabilistically. The presented approach is evaluated on experimental data and it is demonstrated that data-driven measurement model outperforms a manually designed model."

Upon providing an intrinsic link between the properties of the outer vector product and extracted features in tensor decompositions (TDs), the proposed common and individual information extraction from multi-block data is performed through imposing physical meaning to otherwise unconstrained factorisation approaches. This is shown to dramatically reduce the dimensionality of search spaces for subsequent classification procedures and to yield greatly enhanced accuracy.

"arXiv:1711.09061","Mohammadreza Darabi","eess.SP","This paper concerns the transmission of two independent Gaussian sources over a two-user decentralized interference channel, assuming that the transmitters are unaware of the instantaneous CSIs. The availability of the channel state information at receivers (CSIR) is considered in two scenarios of perfect and imperfect CSIR. In the imperfect CSIR case, we consider a more practical assumption of having an MMSE estimation of the channel gain at the receivers. In this case, minimizing the expected achievable distortion associated with each link is considered. Due to the absence of CSI at the transmitters, the Gaussian sources are encoded in a successively refinable manner and the resulting code words are transmitted over the channel using a multi-layer coding technique. Accordingly, the optimal power assignment between code layers leading to the least expected achievable distortion, under a mean-square error criterion is derived for both, the perfect and imperfect CSIR scenarios. Finally, some numerical examples are provided and it is demonstrated that the proposed method results in better performance as compared with the conventional single-layer approach, termed as outage approach."

These signals may offer a method for diagnosing and monitoring heart function. Successful classification of SCG signals in health and disease depends on accurate signal characterization and feature extraction. One approach of determining signal features is to estimate its time-frequency characteristics. In this regard, four different time-frequency distribution (TFD) approaches were used including short-time Fourier transform (STFT), polynomial chirplet transform (PCT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), and smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD). Synthetic SCG signals with known time-frequency properties were generated and used to evaluate the accuracy of the different TFDs in extracting SCG spectral characteristics. Using different TFDs, the instantaneous frequency (IF) of each synthetic signal was determined and the error (NRMSE) in estimating IF was calculated. STFT had lower NRMSE than WVD for synthetic signals considered. PCT and SPWVD were, however, more accurate IF estimators especially for the signal with time-varying frequencies. PCT and SPWVD also provided better discrimination between signal frequency components. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that PCT and SPWVD would be more reliable methods for estimating IF of SCG signals. Analysis of actual SCG signals showed that these signals had multiple spectral components with slightly time-varying frequencies. More studies are needed to investigate SCG spectral properties for healthy subjects as well as patients with different cardiac conditions."

The existing methods usually exploit hidden sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) basis to estimate the cdownlink channel. However, there are at least two shortcomings of these DFT-based methods: 1) they are applicable to uniform linear arrays (ULAs) only, since the DFT basis requires a special structure of ULAs, and 2) they always suffer from a performance loss due to the leakage of energy over some DFT bins. To deal with the above shortcomings, we introduce an off-grid model for downlink channel sparse representation with arbitrary 2D-array antenna geometry, and propose an efficient sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) approach for the sparse channel recovery and off-grid refinement. The main idea of the proposed off-grid method is to consider the sampled grid points as adjustable parameters. Utilizing an in-exact block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, the grid points are refined iteratively to minimize the off-grid gap.

The main idea of the proposed algorithm is considering the general model of the received signal in the SH domain, we reduce the complexity of the ML estimation by breaking it down into two steps: expectation and maximization steps. The proposed algorithm reduces the complexity from 2L-dimensional space to L 2-dimensional space. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm shows at least an improvement of 6dB in robustness in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, the RMSE of the proposed algorithm is very close to the CRB compared to the recent methods in reverberant and noisy environments in the large range of signal to noise ratio."

In this work we apply the MGSA in the paraxial domain. For three given physical parameters - i.e. wavelength, propagation distance and pixel size the computational width in the Fresnel-Transform is fixed. This width can be larger than the real dimension of the input or output images. Consequently, it can induce a padding around the real input and output without given amplitude (intensity) values. To solve this problem, we propose a very simple and efficient solution and compare it to other approaches. We demonstrate that the new modified GSA provides almost perfect results without losing the time efficiency of the simplest method."

However, the implementation with discrete fiber optic FFT components is bulky. Here, we present and analyze a design of an optical FFT in Silicon photonics and evaluate its performance with respect to variations in phase and amplitude.

The basic idea is to transmit sequences of suitably modulated coherent light pulses whose energy can be concentrated in a single temporal bin on the receiver side through optical interference. Two examples of scalable architectures for structured receivers are presented. The first one, based on active polarization switching, maps Hadamard codewords composed from the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) constellation onto the standard pulse position modulation (PPM) format. The second receiver, using solely passive optical elements, converts phase-polarization patterns of coherent light pulses into a single pulse preserving a synchronized time of arrival. Such a conversion enables implementation of a communication protocol equivalent to the PPM scheme but with distributed optical power provided that the intersymbol guard-time exceeds the pattern length."

The main cost of side-lobe reduction is the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level of the output spectrum. We present a single snapshot method which optimizes the selection of most suitable window function among a finite set of candidate windows, say rectangle, Hamming, Blackman windows, for each spectral bin. The main goal is to utilize different window functions at each spectral output depending on the interference level encountered at that spectral bin so as to reduce the SNR loss associated with the windowing operation. Stated differently, the windows with strong interference suppression capabilities are utilized only when a sufficiently powerful interferer is corrupting the spectral bin of interest is present, i.e. only when this window is needed. The achieved reduction in the windowing SNR loss can be important for the detection of low SNR targets."

To meet this requirement, extremely high frequency (EHF), particularly Q (36 to 46 GHz) and V (46 to 56 GHz) bands, is the best viable solution because of its complete availability. The most serious challenge the EHF band poses is the attenuation caused by rain. This paper investigates the effect of the rain on Q and V bands' performances in Bangladeshi climatic conditions. The rain attenuations of the two bands are predicted for the four main regions of Bangladesh using ITU rain attenuation model. The measured rain statistics is used for this prediction. It is observed that the attenuation due to rain in the Q/V band reaches up to 150 dB which is much higher than that of the currently used Ka band. The variability of the rain attenuation is also investigated over different sessions of Bangladesh. The attenuation varies from 40 dB to 170 dB depending on the months. Finally, the amount of rain fade required to compensate the high rain attenuation is also predicted for different elevation angles."

In contrast with the BCS, the BSS charges the batteries in advance and prepares them to be swapped in a considerably short time. Considering that these stations can serve as an intermediate entity between the EV owners and the power system, they can potentially provide unique benefits to the power system.

The high computational cost of the algorithms escalates with the square of the number of signals evaluated, usually in the range of thousands. In this work we propose a re-formulation of a widely used algorithm that allows the estimation of whole brain connectivity in much smaller times. We start from the original implementation of Phase Locking Value (PLV) and re-formulated it in a highly computational efficient way. Besides, this formulation stresses its strong similarity with coherence, which we used to introduce two new metrics insensitive to zero lag synchronization, the imaginary part of PLV (iPLV) and its corrected counterpart (ciPLV). The new implementation of PLV avoids some highly CPU-expensive operations, and achieved a 100-fold speedup over the original algorithm. The new derived metrics were highly robust in the presence of volume conduction. ciPLV, in particular, proved capable of ignoring zero-lag connectivity, while correctly estimating nonzero-lag connectivity. Our implementation of PLV makes it possible to calculate whole-brain connectivity in much shorter times. The results of the simulations using ciPLV suggest that this metric is ideal to measure synchronization in the presence of volume conduction or source leakage effects."

We further formulate an optimal experiment design problem, which selects a sequence of acquisition parameters to encode MR tissue parameters with the maximal SNR efficiency, while respecting the physical constraints and other constraints from the image decoding/reconstruction process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with numerical simulations and phantom experiments, and demonstrate that the optimized experiments substantially reduce data acquisition time and/or improve parameter estimation accuracy. For example, the optimized experiments achieve about a factor of two improvement in the accuracy of $T_2$ maps, while keeping similar or slightly better accuracy of $T_1$ maps.

Its effects become even more pronounced at higher carrier frequencies such as the millimeter-wave frequency bands being considered for 5G systems. In this paper, we quantify the effects of IQI on the performance of different modulation schemes under multipath fading channels. This is realized by developing a general framework for the symbol error rate (SER) analysis of coherent phase shift keying, noncoherent differential phase shift keying and noncoherent frequency shift keying under IQI effects. In this context, the moment generating function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is first derived for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from transmitter (TX) IQI only, receiver (RX) IQI only and joint TX/RX IQI. Capitalizing on this, we derive analytic expressions for the SER of the different modulation schemes. These expressions are corroborated by comparisons with corresponding results from computer simulations and they provide insights into the dependence of IQI on the system parameters. We demonstrate that the effects of IQI differ considerably depending on the considered system as some cases of single-carrier transmission appear robust to IQI, whereas multi-carrier systems experiencing IQI at the RX require compensation in order to achieve a reliable communication link."

Based on the findings of the modal analysis, an improved version of JPVM is proposed which provides both better performance and lower complexity. In particular, it is shown analytically that the optimization of the tangential component of the particle velocity vector, as is done in the original JPVM approach, is very susceptible to errors and thus not pursued anymore. The analysis furthermore provides fundamental insights as to how the spherical harmonics used to describe the 3D variant sound field translate into 2D basis functions as observed on the contours surrounding the zones. By means of simulations, it is verified that discarding the tangential component of the particle velocity vector ultimately leads to an improved performance.

The resonant poles of each SE circulator are modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in synthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatio-temporal modulation (STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase difference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential time-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we show that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM) products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits for an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the resulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and improving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We show that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the required modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude.

The direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with 1-bit DACs is shown to lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the coarse quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on the constructive interference we consider both a quantized linear beamforming scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, and a non-linear mapping scheme where we directly design the transmit signal vector. Due to the 1-bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the non-linear mapping scheme is shown to be non-convex. To solve this problem, the non-convex constraints of the 1-bit DACs are firstly relaxed, followed by an element-wise normalization to satisfy the 1-bit DAC transmission. We further propose a low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages, in which the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected sequentially. Numerical results show that the proposed symbol scaling scheme achieves a comparable performance to the optimization-based non-linear mapping approach, while its corresponding complexity is negligible compared to that of the non-linear scheme."

Application of compressive sensing to array signal processing has opened up an exciting class of algorithms. The authors investigated the application of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for different scenarios, especially to tackle the case of coherent sources and observed inconsistencies in the results. In this paper, a modified OMP algorithm is proposed to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting maximum variance based criterion using only one snapshot. This criterion relaxes the imposed restricted isometry property (RIP) on the measurement matrix to obtain the sources and hence, reduces the sparsity of the input vector to the local OMP algorithm. Moreover, it also tackles sources irrespective of their coherency. The condition for the weak-1 RIP on decreased sparsity is derived and it is shown that how the algorithm gives better result than the OMP algorithm. With an addition to this, a simple method is also presented to calculate source distance from the reference point in a uniform linear sensor array.

Then by removing all assumptions that are difficult to apply, a new procedure is described that does not require neither the transition levels nor the input sequence used to source the quantizer to be known. The experimental results obtained using a commercial 12-b data acquisition system show the applicability of this estimator to real-world type of problems."

During this process, UAVs are gradually being considered as an important part of 5G and expected to play a critical role in enabling more functional diversity for 5G communications. In this article, we conduct an in-depth investigation of mainstream UAV designs and state-of-the-art UAV enabled wireless communication systems.We propose a hierarchical architecture of UAVs with multi-layer and distributed features to facilitate a smooth integration of different mainstream UAVs into the next-generation wireless communication networks.

The results are especially useful for passive radar where direct path and reflected path signals are present. Time delay and Doppler shift estimation is an important fundamental tool in signal processing which has received extensive study for cases with known transmitted signals, but little study for unknown transmitted signals. The presented results generalize previous results for known transmitted signals and show how many looks from the direct path and the reflected path we need to derive an accurate joint estimation of time delay and Doppler shift. After analysis under a simple common signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) model with separated direct and reflected path signals, white clutter-plus-noise and line of sight propagation, extensions to cases with different direct and reflected path SCNRs, correlated clutter-plus-noise, nonseparated direct and reflected path signals and multipath propagation are discussed to support the utility of the CRB with unknown signals."

A notable alternative to the 3GPP Rel. 13 defined LTE-Licensed Assisted Access (LTE-LAA) mechanism for coexistence is the unlicensed LTE (LTE-U) Forum \cite{lteuforum} that prescribed Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) whereby LTE utilizes the unlicensed band as a supplemental downlink unlicensed carrier (to enhance downlink data rate) to normal operation using licensed spectrum. In this work, we provide a new analytical model for performance analysis of unlicensed LTE with fixed duty cycling (LTE-DC) in coexistence with Wi-Fi. Further, the analytical results are cross-validated with ns-3 (www.nsnam.org) based simulation results using a newly developed coexistence stack. Thereafter, notions of {\em fair coexistence} are investigated that can be achieved by tuning the LTE duty cycle. The results show that as the number of Wi-Fi nodes increases, the Wi-Fi network in coexistence with LTE-DC with 0.5 duty cycling achieves a higher throughput than with an identical Wi-Fi network."

For the spherical uncertainty model, a worst-case robust precoder is proposed, while for the stochastic uncertainties, we define a convex optimization problem with probabilistic constraints. We simulate the performance of the proposed robust approaches, and compare them with the existing methods.

To date there is no formal definition, in part because to date we have not established a two-way relationship or mapping between visemes and phonemes. Some evidence suggests that visual speech is highly dependent upon the speaker. So here, we use a phoneme-clustering method to form new phoneme-to-viseme maps for both individual and multiple speakers. We test these phoneme to viseme maps to examine how similarly speakers talk visually and we use signed rank tests to measure the distance between individuals. We conclude that broadly speaking, speakers have the same repertoire of mouth gestures, where they differ is in the use of the gestures."

In this paper, the DOA estimation problem in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with unknown mutual coupling effect is considered. A novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method, named sparse Bayesian learning with mutual coupling (SBLMC), is proposed to improve the DOA estimation resolution. When the compressed sensing (CS)-based methods are used to estimate DOA, the dictionary matrix is formulated by discretizing the detection area, so the off-grid gap is caused by the discretization processes. Different from the existing DOA estimation methods, both the off-grid gap due to sparse sampling in the CS-based method and the unknown mutual coupling effect are considered at the same time in the SBLMC method. With hyperparameters, an expectation maximum (EM)-based method is established in SBLMC, and all the prior distributions for SBLMC are theoretically derived. With regards to the DOA estimation performance, the proposed SBLMC method can outperform the state-of-art methods in the MIMO radar with unknown mutual coupling effect, while keeping the computational complexity relatively low."

In fact, if the independent "time" variable in the heat equation is replaced by the time variable multiplied by $i=\sqrt{-1}$, the heat equation becomes the Schrödinger equation. Two quite different physical phenomena are put in close connection: the heat diffusion in a material and the probability amplitude of particles in an atom. It is a fact of life that the movements of a small particle floating randomly in a fluid, the well-known Brownian motion, is regulated by the Fourier equation while the probabilistic behavior of the matter around us, the quantum world, is driven by the Schrödinger equation but no known stochastic process seems at work here. The apparent simplicity of the formal connection by a "time-rotation", a Wick rotation as it is commonly known, seems to point otherwise. Why this connection? Is there any physical intuitive explanation? Is there any practical value? In this paper, the authors try to shed some light on the above questions. The recent concept of volume quantization in noncommutative geometry, due to Connes, Chamseddine and Mukhanov, points again to stochastic processes also underlying the quantum world making Fourier and Schrödinger strict relatives."

This modality, however, is significantly more challenging than off-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use of future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust predictions.  A popular solution to mitigate this issue consists of feeding neural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames. This introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead features.  This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the future rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden representations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful information about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called Twin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states to be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a "twin" neural network running backwards in time.  The experiments, conducted on a number of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features, and acoustic conditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important advantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at test time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks."

IM technique, when applied to multicarrier waveforms, yields the ability to convey the information not only by M-ary signal constellations as in conventional multicarrier systems but also by the indexes of the subcarriers, which are activated according to the incoming bit stream. Although IM is well studied for OFDM based systems, FBMC with index modulation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we shed light on the potential and implementation of IM technique for QAM based FBMC system. We start with a mathematical model of the IM based QAM-FBMC system (FBMC/QAM-IM) along with the derivation of interference terms at the receiver due to channel distortions and noise. The interference terms including the ones introduced by the multipath channel are analyzed in terms of MSE and output SINR. It is shown with analytical and simulation results that the interference power in FBMC/QAM-IM is smaller compared to that of the conventional FBMC/QAM system as some of the subcarriers are inactive. The performance of FBMC/QAM with IM is investigated by comparing the SIR and output SINR with that of the conventional FBMC/QAM system along with the BER performance which shows that the FBMC/QAM-IM is a promising transmission technique for future wireless networks."

They provide biased estimates if particular conditions regarding the quantization process are not met, as it usually happens in practice. In this paper, a quantile-based estimator is presented, which is based on the Gauss-Markov theorem.

Due to training data limitations and modeling imperfections, it is difficult to achieve believable speaker mimicry without introducing processing artifacts; performance assessment of VC, therefore, usually involves both speaker similarity and quality evaluation by a human panel. As a time-consuming, expensive, and non-reproducible process, it hinders rapid prototyping of new VC technology. We address artifact assessment using an alternative, objective approach leveraging from prior work on spoofing countermeasures (CMs) for automatic speaker verification. Therein, CMs are used for rejecting `fake' inputs such as replayed, synthetic or converted speech but their potential for automatic speech artifact assessment remains unknown. This study serves to fill that gap. As a supplement to subjective results for the 2018 Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC'18) data, we configure a standard constant-Q cepstral coefficient CM to quantify the extent of processing artifacts. Equal error rate (EER) of the CM, a confusability index of VC samples with real human speech, serves as our artifact measure. Two clusters of VCC'18 entries are identified: low-quality ones with detectable artifacts (low EERs), and higher quality ones with less artifacts. None of the VCC'18 systems, however, is perfect: all EERs are < 30 % (the `ideal' value would be 50 %).

"arXiv:1804.07690","Mohammed Abdelwahab, Carlos Busso","eess.AS","The performance of speech emotion recognition is affected by the differences in data distributions between train (source domain) and test (target domain) sets used to build and evaluate the models. This is a common problem, as multiple studies have shown that the performance of emotional classifiers drop when they are exposed to data that does not match the distribution used to build the emotion classifiers. The difference in data distributions becomes very clear when the training and testing data come from different domains, causing a large performance gap between validation and testing performance. Due to the high cost of annotating new data and the abundance of unlabeled data, it is crucial to extract as much useful information as possible from the available unlabeled data. This study looks into the use of adversarial multitask training to extract a common representation between train and test domains. The primary task is to predict emotional attribute-based descriptors for arousal, valence, or dominance. The secondary task is to learn a common representation where the train and test domains cannot be distinguished. By using a gradient reversal layer, the gradients coming from the domain classifier are used to bring the source and target domain representations closer. We show that exploiting unlabeled data consistently leads to better emotion recognition performance across all emotional dimensions. We visualize the effect of adversarial training on the feature representation across the proposed deep learning architecture. The analysis shows that the data representations for the train and test domains converge as the data is passed to deeper layers of the network. We also evaluate the difference in performance when we use a shallow neural network versus a \emph{deep neural network} (DNN) and the effect of the number of shared layers used by the task and domain classifiers."

In the literature, a commonly used group sparsity model assumes that users in each group share a uniform sparsity pattern. In practice, however, this oversimplified assumption usually fails to hold, even for physically close users. Outliers deviated from the uniform sparsity pattern in each group may significantly degrade the effectiveness of common sparsity, and hence bring limited (or negative) gain for channel estimation. To capture a more general group sparse structure in practice, we provide a hybrid model having two sparsity components: commonly shared sparsity and individual sparsity, where the additional individual sparsity accounts for any outliers. Then, we propose a novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based framework to address the joint channel estimation and user grouping problem under the hybrid sparsity model. The framework can fully exploit the common sparsity among nearby users and exclude the harmful effect from outliers simultaneously.

The results are based on 28 measurement campaigns in several frequency bands ranging from 15 to 80 GHz. A conventional XPR model of an MPC assuming a constant mean value fits our measurements very poorly and moreover overestimates the depolarization effect. Our measurements revealed a clear trend that the MPC XPR is inversely proportional to an excess loss in reference to the free-space path loss. The model is physically sound as a higher excess loss is attributed to more lossy interactions or to a greater number of interactions with objects, leading to a greater chance of depolarization. The measurements furthermore showed that the MPC XPR is not strongly frequency or environment dependent. In our MPC XPR model, an MPC with zero-dB excess loss has a mean XPR of 28 dB. The mean XPR decreases half-a-dB as the excess loss increases by every dB and the standard deviation around the mean is 6 dB. The model is applicable to existing channel models to reproduce realistic MPC XPRs for the above 6-GHz radio links."

Using the convex description of DPCIRs and their properties, we formulate two design problems, namely, the SLP power minimization with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and the SLP SINR balancing problem under max-min fairness criterion. The SLP power minimization based on DPCIRs can straightforwardly be written as a quadratic program (QP). We provide a simplified reformulation of this problem which is less computationally complex. The SLP max-min SINR, however, is non-convex in its original form, and hence difficult to tackle. We propose several alternative optimization approaches, including semidefinite program (SDP) formulation and block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization. We discuss and evaluate the loss due to the proposed alternative methods through extensive simulation results."

"arXiv:1804.01246","Mostafa Abdolhamidi, Mahmoud Mohammad-Taheri","eess.SP","A planar DC-blocker suitable for differential mode signaling applications is designed and fabricated. The theory of this component is explained in a new form which utilizes the wave scattering transfer matrix. The proposed interpretation of the transfer matrix is most suitable for series (cascade) elements like DC-blockers. In addition to the theoretical enhancement, design of a compressed balanced DC-blocker inserted through a shielded broadside coupled stripline (SBCSL) transmission line is presented. The return loss of better than 10 dB is obtained at 50-ohm differential-mode input ports of the fabricated DC-blocker in the entire frequency range of 5.6-8.4 GHz. The lowest air-gap width in the presented structure is about 10 times bigger than that of a conventional coupled-line structure. So, the structure is much less sensitive to fabrication tolerances. Moreover, the DC-blocker is likely to tolerate higher DC-voltage differences. Also, a demonstration for a millimeter-wave version of this DC-blocker suitable for integrated circuits (ICs) applications is proposed for future development. The final achievement of this paper is design and fabrication of a wideband substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)-mediated balun structure for single-ended measurement of a balanced SBCSL component. The fabricated balun exhibits a nearly perfect coaxial-mode to coupled-stripline differential-mode conversion in the full range of 5-9 GHz. The presented balun is successfully utilized to derive the scattering parameters (S-parameters) of the fabricated balanced SBCSL DC-blocker."

Moreover, centralized decision-making and data fusion schemes commonly used by these networks turn these decision points into single points of failure, which are likely to be exploited by smart attackers. In order to face this serious security thread, we propose a novel scheme that enables distributed data aggregation and decision-making by following social learning principles. Our proposed scheme makes sensor nodes to act resembling the manners of agents within a social network. We analytically examine how local actions of individual agents can propagate through the whole network, affecting the collective behaviour. Finally, we show how social learning can enable network resilience against data falsification attacks, even when a significant portion of the nodes have been compromised by the adversary."

The presence of damage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art non-contact measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream wind turbine blade (WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade."

"arXiv:1804.02084","Donghoon Lee, Dimitris Berberidis, Georgios B. Giannakis","eess.SP","Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) is an emerging technology to locate physical objects in a geographical area covered by wireless networks. From the attenuation measurements collected at spatially distributed sensors, radio tomography capitalizes on spatial loss fields (SLFs) measuring the absorption of radio frequency waves at each location along the propagation path. These SLFs can be utilized for interference management in wireless communication networks, environmental monitoring, and survivor localization after natural disaster such as earthquakes. Key to success of RTI is to model accurately the shadowing effects as the bi-dimensional integral of the SLF scaled by a weight function, which is estimated using regularized regression. However, the existing approaches are less effective when the propagation environment is heterogeneous. To cope with this, the present work introduces a piecewise homogeneous SLF governed by a hidden Markov random field (MRF) model. Efficient and tractable SLF estimators are developed by leveraging Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Furthermore, an uncertainty sampling method is developed to adaptively collect informative measurements in estimating the SLF. Numerical tests using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate capabilities of the proposed algorithm for radio tomography and channel-gain estimation."

We propose a novel DPD processing and learning technique for an antenna sub-array, which utilizes a combined signal of the individual power amplifier (PA) outputs in conjunction with a decorrelation-based learning rule. In effect, the proposed approach results in minimizing the nonlinear distortions in the direction of the intended receiver. This feature is highly desirable, since emissions in other directions are naturally weak due to beamforming. The proposed parameter learning technique requires only a single observation receiver, and therefore supports simple hardware implementation. It is also shown to clearly outperform the current state-of-the-art technique which utilizes only a single PA for learning. Analysis of the feedback network amplitude and phase imbalances reveals that the technique is robust even to high levels of such imbalances. Finally, we also show that the array system out-of-band emissions are well-behaving in all spatial directions, and essentially below those of the corresponding single-antenna transmitter, due to the combined effects of the DPD and beamforming."

This method usually requires many iterations for the signal reconstruction process and depending on the inputs, it does not always produce high-quality audio signals. To overcome these shortcomings, we apply a learning-based approach to the signal reconstruction problem by modeling the signal reconstruction process using a deep neural network and training it using the idea of a generative adversarial network.

"arXiv:1804.02470","Gang Yao, Ashwin Dani","eess.IV","An efficient iterative Earth Mover's Distance (iEMD) algorithm for visual tracking is proposed in this paper. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used as the similarity measure to search for the optimal template candidates in feature-spatial space in a video sequence. The computation of the EMD is formulated as the transportation problem from linear programming. The efficiency of the EMD optimization problem limits its use for visual tracking. To alleviate this problem, a transportation-simplex method is used for EMD optimization and a monotonically convergent iterative optimization algorithm is developed. The local sparse representation is used as the appearance models for the iEMD tracker. The maximum-alignment-pooling method is used for constructing a sparse coding histogram which reduces the computational complexity of the EMD optimization. The template update algorithm based on the EMD is also presented. The iEMD tracking algorithm assumes small inter-frame movement in order to guarantee convergence. When the camera is mounted on a moving robot, e.g., a flying quadcopter, the camera could experience a sudden and rapid motion leading to large inter-frame movements. To ensure that the tracking algorithm converges, a gyro-aided extension of the iEMD tracker is presented, where synchronized gyroscope information is utilized to compensate for the rotation of the camera. The iEMD algorithm's performance is evaluated using eight publicly available datasets. The performance of the iEMD algorithm is compared with seven state-of-the-art tracking algorithms based on relative percentage overlap.

This approach allows deriving a novel class of single-tap frequency domain (FD) receivers with a quasi-linear computational complexity in block length, thanks to Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) based implementation. This framework is exposed in detail, through the design of a novel double-loop single-carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE), where self-iterations of the equalizer with the demapper, and turbo iterations with the decoder, provide numerous combinations for the performance and complexity trade-off. Furthermore, the flexibility of this framework is illustrated with the derivation of an overlap FDE, used for time-varying channel equalization, among others, and with the design of a FD multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detector, used for spatial multiplexing. Through these different receiver design problems, this framework is shown to improve the mitigation of inter-symbol, inter-block and multi-antenna interferences, compared to alternative single-tap FD structures of previous works.

Accordingly, to capture low, medium and high frequencies we seek a digraph (D)GFT such that the orthonormal frequency components are as spread as possible in the graph spectral domain. To that end, we advocate a two-step design whereby we: (i) find the maximum directed variation (i.e., a novel notion of frequency on a digraph) a candidate basis vector can attain; and (ii) minimize a smooth spectral dispersion function over the achievable frequency range to obtain the desired spread DGFT basis. Both steps involve non-convex, orthonormality-constrained optimization problems, which are efficiently tackled via a provably convergent, feasible optimization method on the Stiefel manifold. We also propose a heuristic to construct the DGFT basis from Laplacian eigen-vectors of an undirected version of the digraph. We show that the spectral-dispersion minimization problem can be cast as supermodular optimization over the set of candidate frequency components, whose orthonormality can be enforced via a matroid basis constraint. This motivates adopting a scalable greedy algorithm to obtain an approximate solution with quantifiable worst-case spectral dispersion. We illustrate the effectiveness of our DGFT algorithms through numerical tests on synthetic and real-world networks. We also carry out a graph-signal denoising task, whereby the DGFT basis is used to decompose and then low-pass filter temperatures recorded across the United States."

"arXiv:1804.10454","Andreas Meinel, Henrich Kolkhorst, Michael Tangermann","eess.SP","Data-driven spatial filtering approaches are commonly used to assess rhythmic brain activity from multichannel recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG). As spatial filter estimation is prone to noise, non-stationarity effects and limited data, a high model variability induced by slight changes of, e.g., involved hyperparameters is generally encountered. These aspects challenge the assessment of functionally relevant features which are of special importance in closed-loop applications as, e.g., in the field of rehabilitation. We propose a data-driven method to identify groups of reliable and functionally relevant oscillatory components computed by a spatial filtering approach. Therefore, we initially embrace the variability of decoding models in a large configuration space before condensing information by density-based clustering of components' functional signatures. Exemplified for a hand force task with rich within-trial structure, the approach was evaluated on EEG data of 18 healthy subjects. We found that functional characteristics of single components are revealed by distinct temporal dynamics of their event-related power changes. Based on a within-subject analysis, our clustering revealed seven groups of homogeneous envelope dynamics on average. To support introspection by practitioners, we provide a set of metrics to characterize and validate single clusterings. We show that identified clusters contain components of strictly confined frequency ranges, dominated by the alpha and beta band. Our method is applicable to any spatial filtering algorithm. Despite high model variability, it allows capturing and monitoring relevant oscillatory features. We foresee its application in closed-loop applications such as brain-computer interface based protocols in stroke rehabilitation."

However, using these units for resilience is not sufficient to economically justify their installation and, therefore, these units are often installed in locations where they incur the greatest economic value during normal operations. Motivated by the recent progress in transportable ES technologies, i.e. ES units can be moved using public transportation routes, this paper proposes to use this spatial flexibility to bridge the gap between the economically optimal locations during normal operations and disaster-specific locations where extra back-up capacity is necessary. We propose a two-stage optimization model that optimizes investments in mobile ES units in the first stage and can re-route the installed mobile ES units in the second stage to avoid the expected load shedding caused by disaster forecasts.

The QTFs help to determine a real-time range that excludes outliers. This range is fed into the CMTF which is responsible for mitigating impulsive noise. The CMTF is a nonlinear analog filter and its nonlinearity is controlled by the aforementioned range. Proper selection of this range ensures the improvement of the desired signal quality in impulsive environment. It is important to note that the proposed ACDL behaves like a linear filter in case of no impulsive noise. In this context, the traditional matched filter construction is modified to ensure distortionless processing of the desired signal. The performance improvement of the proposed ACDL is due to the fact that unlike other nonlinear methods, the ACDL is implemented in the analog domain where the outliers are still broadband and distinguishable. Simulation results in PRIME (OFDM-based narrowband PLC system) demonstrate the superior BER performance of ACDL relative to other nonlinear approaches such as blanking and clipping in impulsive noise environments."

The effects of channel state information (CSI) availability on secrecy outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived. Diversity is achieved from the direct and relaying paths both at the destination and at the eavesdropper by combinations of maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) schemes. An asymptotic analysis is provided when each hop SNR is the same in the balanced case and when it is different in the unbalanced case. The analysis shows that both hops can be a bottleneck for secure communication; however, they do not affect the secrecy identically. While it is observed that CSI knowledge can improve secrecy, the amount of improvement for SOP is more when the required rate is low and for ESR when the operating SNR is also low. It is also shown that the source to eavesdropper link SNR is more crucial for secure communication."

The unified design method is assessed for a CRA configuration in which dielectric scatterers are added to the surface of a TRA. The design results demonstrate the ability of the unified design method to enhance the CS reconstruction capabilities of the CRA."

The agile nature of UAVs for serving users at different locations can help to dynamically optimize coverage and quality-of-service (QoS) in future networks. In this work, we explore the small scale temporal and spatial characteristics of mmWave air-toground (AG) line-of-sight (LOS) propagation channels at 28 GHz in different environmental scenarios: dense-urban, suburban, rural, and over sea using omni-directional antennas employing Wireless InSite ray tracing software. We classify the received multipath components (MPCs) into persistent and non-persistent components. The small scale temporal and spatial characteristics of the AG propagation channel are found to be dependent on the scatterer properties: number, distribution, and geometry. Additionally, clustering of MPCs in the time and spatial domain for different environments is found to be dependent on the scatterer properties and receiver sensitivity. When the height of the UAV is comparable to the height of the scatterers, we observe large temporal and angular spreads."

We formulate an energy and traffic aware resource allocation optimization problem, where a joint design of the beamformers, power and sub-carrier allocation, and users scheduling is proposed. The problem minimizes the sum data buffer lengths of each user in the network by using the harvested energy. A practical uplink user rate-dependent decoding energy consumption is included in the total energy consumption at the small cell base stations. Hence, harvested energy is shared with both downlink and uplink users. Owing to the non-convexity of the problem, a faster convergence sub-optimal algorithm based on successive parametric convex approximation framework is proposed. The algorithm is implemented in a distributed fashion, by using the alternating direction method of multipliers, which offers not only the limited information exchange between the base stations, but also fast convergence. Numerical results advocate the redesigning of the resource allocation strategy when the energy at the base station is shared among the downlink and uplink transmissions."

In this paper, we thus consider the use of GFDM to allow an unlicensed secondary user (SU) to access a spectrum hole. However, in an extremely congested spectrum scenario, both active incumbent primary users (PUs) on the left and right channels of the spectrum hole will experience OOB interference. While constraining this interference, we thus investigate the problem of power allocation to the SU transmit subcarriers in order to maximize the overall data rate where the SU receiver is employing Matched filter (MF) and zero-forcing (ZF) structures. The power allocation problem is thus solved as a classic convex optimization problem. Finally, total transmission rate of GFDM is compared with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). For instance, when right and left interference temperature should be below 10 dBm, the capacity gain of GFDM over OFDM is 400 %."

In this paper, we develop an algorithm for Fourier ptychographic microscopy with such multiplexed illumination. Specifically, we consider gradient descent type updates and propose an analytical step size that ensures the convergence of the iterates to a stationary point. Furthermore, we propose an accelerated version of our algorithm (with the same step size) which significantly improves the convergence speed.

"arXiv:1803.03736","Ebrahim Karami, Savo Glisic","eess.SP","In this paper we present matrix game-theoretic models for joint routing, network coding, and scheduling problem. First routing and network coding are modeled by using a new approach based on compressed topology matrix that takes into account the inherent multicast gain of the network. The scheduling is optimized by a new approach called network graph soft coloring. Soft graph coloring is designed by switching between different components of a wireless network graph, which we refer to as graph fractals, with appropriate usage rates. The network components, represented by graph fractals, are a new paradigm in network graph partitioning that enables modeling of the network optimization problem by using the matrix game framework. In the proposed game which is a nonlinear cubic game, the strategy sets of the players are links, path, and network components. The outputs of this game model are mixed strategy vectors of the second and the third players at equilibrium. Strategy vector of the second player specifies optimum multi-path routing and network coding solution while mixed strategy vector of the third players indicates optimum switching rate among different network components or membership probabilities for optimal soft scheduling approach. Optimum throughput is the value of the proposed nonlinear cubic game at equilibrium. The proposed nonlinear cubic game is solved by extending fictitious playing method. Numerical and simulation results prove the superior performance of the proposed techniques compared to the conventional schemes using hard graph coloring."

Most of the complexity of the video coder depends on the complexity of the motion estimation step. The original motion estimation algorithm has a remarkable complexity and therefore many improvements were proposed to enhance the crude version of the motion estimation. The basic idea of many of these works were to optimize some distortion function for mean squared error (MSE) or sum of absolute difference (SAD) in block matching But it is shown that these metrics do not conclude the quality as it is, on the other hand, they are not compatible with the human visual system (HVS). In this paper we explored the usage of the image quality metrics in the video coding and more specific in the motion estimation. We have utilized the perceptual image quality metrics instead of MSE or SAD in the block based motion estimation. Three different metrics have used: structural similarity or SSIM, complex wavelet structural similarity or CW-SSIM, visual information fidelity or VIF. Experimental results showed that usage of the quality criterions can improve the compression rate while the quality remains fix and thus better quality in coded video at the same bit budget."

This combination strikes a good balance between high-capacity communications and parsimonious channel modeling, and also brings limited feedback schemes for downlink channel estimation within reach. However, most existing channel estimation work under the DD model has not considered DP arrays, perhaps because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank four-way tensor, and thus the parameters can be effectively estimated via tensor decomposition algorithms. To reduce computational complexity, we show that the problem can be recast as a four-snapshot three-dimensional harmonic retrieval problem, which can be solved using computationally efficient subspace methods. On the theory side, we show that the DD channel with DP arrays is identifiable under very mild conditions, leveraging identifiability of low-rank tensors. Numerical simulations are employed to showcase the effectiveness of our methods."

Adopting a hierarchical structure, the set of sensors is divided into multiple clusters where the value of the sensing parameter is almost constant in each cluster. The members of each cluster transmit their sensing information to the local fusion center (LFC) of their corresponding cluster, where using some fusion rule, the received information is combined, and then possibly sent to a higher-level central fusion center (CFC). A two-phase processing scheme is also envisioned, in which the first phase is dedicated to detection in the LFC, and the second phase is dedicated to estimation in both the LFC and the CFC. The focus of the present paper is on the problem of decision fusion at the LFC: we propose hard- and soft-decision maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms, which exhibit flexibility in minimizing the total cost imposed by incorrect detections in the first phase. The proposed algorithms are simulated and compared with conventional fusion techniques. It is shown that the proposed techniques result in lower cost. Furthermore, when the number of sensors or the amount of contamination increases, the performance gap between the proposed algorithms and the existing methods also widens."

We also estimate the variation of power spectrum to evaluate the time independence of the auto-covariance function. Our results show that, with 95% confidence, the assumption of WSS is met for at most 90% of the cases with window lengths of 5 seconds for the channels between the hubs of different BANs. Additionally, in the best-case scenario, the hub-to-hub channel remains reasonably stationary (with more than 80% probability of satisfying the null hypothesis) for longer window lengths of more than 10 seconds.

Of interest is the need to allow someone to monitor travel momentum and associated congestion in any location in space in real time. However, despite an abundant literature in taxi data visualization and its applicability to travel analysis, no easy method exists. To measure taxi travel momentum at a location, current methods require filtering taxi trajectories that stop at a location at a particular time range, which is computationally expensive. We propose an alternative, computationally cheaper way based on pre-processing vector fields from the trajectories. Algorithms are formalized for generating vector kernel density to estimate a travel-model-free vector field-based representation of travel momentum in an urban space. The algorithms are shared online as an open source GIS 3D extension called VectorKD.

In this study, SCG, ECG, and respiratory flow rate (RFR) signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy subjects. The lung volume information was calculated from the RFR and was used to group the SCG events into low and high lung-volume groups. LLV and HLV SCG events were then used to estimate the subjects HR as well as the HR during LLV and HLV in 3 different postural positions, namely supine, 45 degree heads-up, and sitting. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested against the standard ECG measurements. Results showed that the HR estimations from the SCG and ECG signals were in a good agreement (bias of 0.08 bpm). All subjects were found to have a higher HR during HLV (HR$_\text{HLV}$) compared to LLV (HR$_\text{LLV}$) at all postural positions. The HR$_\text{HLV}$/HR$_\text{LLV}$ ratio was 1.11$\pm$0.07, 1.08$\pm$0.05, 1.09$\pm$0.04, and 1.09$\pm$0.04 (mean$\pm$SD) for supine, 45 degree-first trial, 45 degree-second trial, and sitting positions, respectively.

This is an ill-posed learning problem since it requires inferring the joint probability distribution from marginals. Joint learning of coupled mappings $F_{AB}: A \rightarrow B$ and $F_{BA}: B \rightarrow A$ is commonly used by the state-of-the-art methods, like CycleGAN [Zhu et al., 2017], to learn this translation by introducing cycle consistency requirement to the learning problem, i.e. $F_{AB}(F_{BA}(B)) \approx B$ and $F_{BA}(F_{AB}(A)) \approx A$. Cycle consistency enforces the preservation of the mutual information between input and translated images. However, it does not explicitly enforce $F_{BA}$ to be an inverse operation to $F_{AB}$. We propose a new deep architecture that we call invertible autoencoder (InvAuto) to explicitly enforce this relation. This is done by forcing an encoder to be an inverted version of the decoder, where corresponding layers perform opposite mappings and share parameters. The mappings are constrained to be orthonormal. The resulting architecture leads to the reduction of the number of trainable parameters (up to $2$ times). We present image translation results on benchmark data sets and demonstrate state-of-the art performance of our approach. Finally, we test the proposed domain adaptation method on the task of road video conversion.

One failure mode of the MWT is due to the excess energy in the tube during internal arcing events. Crowbar is used to protect the MWT by diverting the energy during fault. To compute the energy released into the MWT, the dc fault current model and the MWT model are essential. An equivalent fuse wire model is utilized for the MWT for the crowbar applications. The paper proposes a model for the dc fault current, the analysis for which is based on Joules Integral energy concept. The model provides flexibility to choose a range of practically observed reactance to resistance ratio (X/R) of transformer and also allows the use of a range of dc current limiting resistances that are utilized in the High Voltage (HV) power supply circuits in Microwave applications. The non-linearity of the system due to the multipulse diode rectifier is also considered by introducing a correction factor in the model. This paper shows that the same correction factor can be applied for both dc side parallel and series connected rectifier circuits. Both dc fault current and MWT models are verified experimentally.

It references issues that concern mining sensor data in cyber physical systems (CPS). The advance of cyber physical systems has created a significant change in the architecture of sensor and actor data. It affects the complexity of the observed systems in general, the number of signals being processed, the spatial distribution of the signal sources on a machine or plant and the global availability of the data. There are different definitions for what constitutes cyber physical systems: the most succinct and pertinent to the work shown in this paper is the definition given by the IEEE: A CPS is a system with a coupling of the cyber aspects of computing and communications with the physical aspects of dynamics and engineering that must abide by the laws of physics. This includes sensor networks, real-time and hybrid systems. Results computed from sensor and actor data must obey the equations used for modelling the physics of the observed system - this fundamentally poses an inverse problem. Such problems are not covered sufficiently by literature addressing mining of sensor data. Even available standard books on mining sensor data do not discuss the special nature of sensor data. Typically, present approaches of mining data rely on correlation as being a sole, reliable measure for significance. It is not taken into account that the inverse solutions to the model-describing equations are required to establish a semantic link between a sensor observation and its precedent cause. Without this link - without causality - there can be no physics based knowledge discovery."

However, due to the densification of small base stations (SBSs) and the dynamic variety of the number of Wi-Fi nodes in the overlapping areas, the licensed channel interference and the unlicensed channel collision could seriously influence the Quality of Service (QoS) and the energy consumption. In this paper, jointly considering time-variant wireless channel conditions, dynamic traffic loads, and random numbers of Wi-Fi nodes, we address an adaptive spectrum access and power allocation problem that enables minimizing the system power consumption under a certain queue stability constraint in the LAA-enabled SBSs and Wi-Fi networks. The complex stochastic optimization problem is rewritten as the difference of two convex (D.C.) program in the framework of Lyapunov optimization, thus developing an online energy-aware optimal algorithm. We also characterize the performance bounds of the proposed algorithm with a tradeoff of [O(1=V ); O(V )] between power consumption and delay theoretically.

We present a novel numerical model for the PSF of an optical system that can efficiently model both experimental measurements and lens design simulations of the PSF. The numerical basis for this model is a non-linear regression of the PSF with an artificial neural network (ANN). The novelty lies in the portability and the parameterization of this model, which allows to apply this model in basically any conceivable optical simulation scenario, e.g. inserting a measured lens into a computer game to train autonomous vehicles. We present a lens measurement series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only on the parameters defocus, field and azimuth. By convolving existing images and videos with this PSF model we apply the measured lens as a transfer function, therefore generating an image as if it were seen with the measured lens itself. Applications of this method are in any optical scenario, but we focus on the context of autonomous driving, where quality of the detection algorithms depends directly on the optical quality of the used camera system.

"arXiv:1801.01959","Wen-Liang Hwang, Ping-Tzan Huang, Tai-Lang Jong","eess.SP","Frames are the foundation of the linear operators used in the decomposition and reconstruction of signals, such as the discrete Fourier transform, Gabor, wavelets, and curvelet transforms. The emergence of sparse representation models has shifted of the emphasis in frame theory toward sparse l1-minimization problems. In this paper, we apply frame theory to the sparse representation of signals in which a synthesis dictionary is used for a frame and an analysis dictionary is used for a dual frame. We sought to formulate a novel dual frame design in which the sparse vector obtained through the decomposition of any signal is also the sparse solution representing signals based on a reconstruction frame. Our findings demonstrate that this type of dual frame cannot be constructed for over-complete frames, thereby precluding the use of any linear analysis operator in driving the sparse synthesis coefficient for signal representation. Nonetheless, the best approximation to the sparse synthesis solution can be derived from the analysis coefficient using the canonical dual frame. In this study, we developed a novel dictionary learning algorithm (called Parseval K-SVD) to learn a tight-frame dictionary. We then leveraged the analysis and synthesis perspectives of signal representation with frames to derive optimization formulations for problems pertaining to image recovery. Our preliminary, results demonstrate that the images recovered using this approach are correlated to the frame bounds of dictionaries, thereby demonstrating the importance of using different dictionaries for different applications."
"arXiv:1801.02783","Chao Luo, Yih-Fang Huang, Vijay Gupta","eess.SP","This paper presents a dynamic pricing and energy management framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging service providers. To set the charging prices, the service providers faces three uncertainties: the volatility of wholesale electricity price, intermittent renewable energy generation, and spatial-temporal EV charging demand. The main objective of our work here is to help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV charging demand at each charging station, and introduce a quantitative measure for customer satisfaction. Both the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm are employed to derive the optimal charging prices and determine how much electricity to be purchased from the wholesale market in each planning horizon. Simulation results show that DP algorithm achieves an increased profit (up to 9%) compared to the greedy algorithm (the benchmark algorithm) under certain scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the integration of a low-cost energy storage into the system can not only improve the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the end customers from the volatile wholesale market."

This solution is compared to nonlinear solvers more effected by noise, but able to provide a position estimation without the knowledge of any starting condition. The linear least square solution is able to minimize Gaussian noise by solving an overdetermined equation with the MoorePenrose pseudoinverse. Unfortunately this solution fails if it comes to non Gaussian noise. This publication presents a direct solution which is able to use prefiltered data for the LPM (RNL) equation.

Methods: Diffusion-weighted images exhibit both transform sparsity and low-rankness. These properties can jointly be exploited to accelerate CDTI, especially when a phase map is applied to correct for the phase inconsistency across diffusion directions, thereby enhancing low-rankness. The proposed method is evaluated both ex vivo and in vivo, and is compared to methods using either a low-rank or sparsity constraint alone. Results: Compared to using a low-rank or sparsity constraint alone, the proposed method preserves more accurate helix angle features, the transmural continuum across the myocardium wall, and mean diffusivity at higher acceleration, while yielding significantly lower bias and higher intraclass correlation coefficient. Conclusion: Low-rankness and compressed sensing together facilitate acceleration for both ex vivo and in vivo CDTI, improving reconstruction accuracy compared to employing either constraint alone. Significance: Compared to previous methods for accelerating CDTI, the proposed method has the potential to reach higher acceleration while preserving myofiber architecture features which may allow more spatial coverage, higher spatial resolution and shorter temporal footprint in the future."

Targets of interest are often represented by signals captured using low-frequency (UHF to L-band) ultra-wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology. This technology has been used in various applications, including ground penetration and sensing-through-the-wall. However, the technology still faces a significant issues regarding low-resolution SAR imagery in this particular frequency band, low radar cross sections (RCS), small objects compared to radar signal wavelengths, and heavy interference. The classification problem has been firstly, and partially, addressed by sparse representation-based classification (SRC) method which can extract noise from signals and exploit the cross-channel information. Despite providing potential results, SRC-related methods have drawbacks in representing nonlinear relations and dealing with larger training sets. In this paper, we propose a Simultaneous Decomposition and Classification Network (SDCN) to alleviate noise inferences and enhance classification accuracy. The network contains two jointly trained sub-networks: the decomposition sub-network handles denoising, while the classification sub-network discriminates targets from confusers. Experimental results show significant improvements over a network without decomposition and SRC-related methods."

However, the traditional methods, like short time Fourier transform and Cohen distribution, suffer from the low resolution or the interference of the cross terms. To solve these issues, we put forward a new sparse time-frequency analysis model by using the Lp-quasinorm constraint, which is capable of fitting the sparsity prior knowledge in the frequency domain. In the proposed model, we regard the short time truncated data as the observation of sparse representation and design a dictionary matrix, which builds up the relationship between the short time measurement and the sparse spectrum. Based on the relationship and the Lp-quasinorm feasible domain, the proposed model is established. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted to solve the proposed model. Experiments are then conducted on several theoretical signals and applied to the seismic signal spectrum decomposition, indicating that the proposed method is able to obtain a higher time-frequency distribution than state-of-the-art time-frequency methods. Thus, the proposed method is of great importance to reservoir exploration."

When a short duration laser pulse illuminates the tissue as a target of imaging, tissue induces US waves and detected waves can be used to reconstruct optical absorption distribution. Since receiving part of PA consists of US waves, a large number of beamforming algorithms in US imaging can be applied on PA imaging. Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming algorithm in US imaging. However, make use of DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images and large scale of off-axis signals contribution. To address these problems a new paradigm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS), which was used as a reconstruction algorithm in confocal microwave imaging for breast cancer detection, was introduced for US imaging. Consequently, DMAS was used in PA imaging systems and it was shown this algorithm results in resolution enhancement and sidelobe degrading. However, in presence of high level of noise the reconstructed image still suffers from high contribution of noise. In this paper, a modified version of DMAS beamforming algorithm is proposed based on DAS inside DMAS formula expansion. The quantitative and qualitative results show that proposed method results in more noise reduction and resolution enhancement in expense of contrast degrading. For the simulation, two-point target, along with lateral variation in two depths of imaging are employed and it is evaluated under high level of noise in imaging medium. Proposed algorithm in compare to DMAS, results in reduction of lateral valley for about 19 dB followed by more distinguished two-point target.

There is a requirement for computationally efficient and real-time implementable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a high quality and computationally efficient time- and pitch-scaling methodology based on the glottal closure instants (GCIs) or epochs in speech signals. The proposed algorithm, termed as epoch-synchronous overlap-add time/pitch-scaling (ESOLA-TS/PS), segments speech signals into overlapping short-time frames and then the adjacent frames are aligned with respect to the epochs and the frames are overlap-added to synthesize time-scale modified speech. Pitch scaling is achieved by resampling the time-scaled speech by a desired sampling factor. We also propose a concept of epoch embedding into speech signals, which facilitates the identification and time-stamping of samples corresponding to epochs and using them for time/pitch-scaling to multiple scaling factors whenever desired, thereby contributing to faster and efficient implementation. The results of perceptual evaluation tests reported in this paper indicate the superiority of ESOLA over state-of-the-art techniques. ESOLA significantly outperforms the conventional pitch synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA) techniques in terms of perceptual quality and intelligibility of the modified speech. Unlike the waveform similarity overlap-add (WSOLA) or synchronous overlap-add (SOLA) techniques, the ESOLA technique has the capability to do exact time-scaling of speech with high quality to any desired modification factor within a range of 0.5 to 2. Compared to synchronous overlap-add with fixed synthesis (SOLAFS), the ESOLA is computationally advantageous and at least three times faster."

Researchers seeking to compensate for mmWave's high path loss and to achieve both gain and directivity have proposed that mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems make use of beamforming systems. Hybrid beamforming in mmWave demonstrates promising performance in achieving high gain and directivity by using phase shifters at the analog processing block. What remains a problem, however, is the actual implementation of mmWave beamforming systems; to fabricate such a system is costly and complex. With the aim of reducing such cost and complexity, this article presents actual prototypes of the lens antenna as an effective device to be used in the future 5G mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase shifter enables beamforming without the heavy network of active phase shifters, while gain and directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens. Proposed in this article are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the other for mobile usage. Their performance is evaluated using measurements and simulation data along with link-level analysis via a software defined radio (SDR) platform. Results show the promising potential of the lens antenna for its high gain and directivity, and its improved beam-switching feasibility compared to when a lens is not used. System-level evaluations reveal the significant throughput enhancement in both real indoor and outdoor environments.

In wideband systems, such as cognitive radios, noise at the receiver can originate from non-linearity present in the RF front end, time-varying thermal noise within the receiver radio system, and noise from adjacent network nodes. Several denoising techniques have been proposed for cognitive radios, some of which are applied during spectrum sensing and others to received noisy signal during communication. Examples of some of these techniques used for noise cancellation in received signals are least mean square (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms have low performance with non-linear signals and cannot locate a global optimum solution for noise cancellation. Therefore, application of global search optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, is considered for noise cancellation. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LMS algorithms are implemented and their performances are evaluated. Extensive simulations were performed where Gaussian and non-linear random noise were added to the transmitted signal.

Without structural assumptions, such as modeling the variables as a Markov chain, tree, or other graphical model, joint PMF estimation is often considered mission impossible - the number of unknowns grows exponentially with the number of variables. But who gives us the structural model? Is there a generic, 'non-parametric' way to control joint PMF complexity without relying on a priori structural assumptions regarding the underlying probability model? Is it possible to discover the operational structure without biasing the analysis up front? What if we only observe random subsets of the variables, can we still reliably estimate the joint PMF of all? This paper shows, perhaps surprisingly, that if the joint PMF of any three variables can be estimated, then the joint PMF of all the variables can be provably recovered under relatively mild conditions. The result is reminiscent of Kolmogorov's extension theorem - consistent specification of lower-order distributions induces a unique probability measure for the entire process. The difference is that for processes of limited complexity (rank of the high-order PMF) it is possible to obtain complete characterization from only third-order distributions. In fact not all third order PMFs are needed; and under more stringent conditions even second-order will do. Exploiting multilinear (tensor) algebra, this paper proves that such higher-order PMF completion can be guaranteed - several pertinent identifiability results are derived. It also provides a practical and efficient algorithm to carry out the recovery task. Judiciously designed simulations and real-data experiments on movie recommendation and data classification are presented to showcase the effectiveness of the approach."

However, as the acquisition conditions become more unconstrained and as image quality is typically lower than dedicated iris acquisition systems, the accurate segmentation of iris regions is crucial for these devices. In this work, an end to end Fully Convolutional Deep Neural Network (FCDNN) design is proposed to perform the iris segmentation task for lower-quality iris images. The network design process is explained in detail, and the resulting network is trained and tuned using several large public iris datasets. A set of methods to generate and augment suitable lower quality iris images from the high-quality public databases are provided. The network is trained on Near InfraRed (NIR) images initially and later tuned on additional datasets derived from visible images. Comprehensive inter-database comparisons are provided together with results from a selection of experiments detailing the effects of different tunings of the network. Finally, the proposed model is compared with SegNet-basic, and a near-optimal tuning of the network is compared to a selection of other state-of-art iris segmentation algorithms. The results show very promising performance from the optimized Deep Neural Networks design when compared with state-of-art techniques applied to the same lower quality datasets."

It aims to create an ecosystem of connected objects and provide ubiquitous connectivity between trillions of multi-role devices, such as sensors and actuators. Although recent advancements in miniaturization of devices with higher computational capabilities and ultra-low power communication technologies have enabled the vast deployment of sensors and actuators everywhere, such an evolution calls for fundamental changes in hardware design, software, network architecture, data analytic, data storage and power sources. A large portion of IoT devices cannot be powered by batteries only anymore, as they will be installed in hard to reach areas and regular battery replacement and maintenance is infeasible. A viable solution is to use energy harvesting techniques to harvest energy from environment and provide enough energy to the devices to perform their operations. This will significantly increase the device life time and eliminate the need for the battery as an energy source. This survey aims at providing a comprehensive study on energy harvesting techniques as alternative and promising solutions to power IoT devices. We present the main design challenges of IoT devices in terms of energy and power and provide design considerations for a successful implementations of self-powered IoT devices. We then specifically focus on vibration energy harvesting techniques using piezoelectric materials and briefly present a newly developed piezoelectric materials with enhanced electrical properties."

With the principle of adaptive beamforming, it is shown that the optimal weight vector for array response control can be equivalently obtained with a different manner, in which a linear transformation is conducted on the quiescent weight. This new strategy is utilized to realize multi-point precise array response control from one given weight vector, and it obtains a closed-form solution. A careful analysis shows that the response levels at given points can be independently, flexibly and accurately adjusted by simply varying the parameter vector, and that the uncontrolled region remains almost unchanged.

However, there are many difficulties in analyzing EEG data, including its complex composition, low amplitude as well as low signal-to-noise ratio. Some of the existing methods of analysis are based on feature extraction and machine learning to differentiate the phase of schizophrenia that samples belong to. However, medical research requires the use of machine learning not only to give more accurate classification results, but also to give the results that can be applied to pathological studies. The main purpose of this study is to obtain the weight values as the representation of influence of each frequency band on the classification of schizophrenia phases on the basis of a more effective classification method using the LES feature extraction, and then the weight values are processed and applied to improve the accuracy of machine learning classification. We propose a method called weight-voting to obtain the weights of sub-bands features by using results of classification for voting to fit the actual categories of EEG data, and using weights for reclassification. Through this method, we can first obtain the influence of each band in distinguishing three schizophrenia phases, and analyze the effect of band features on the risk of schizophrenia contributing to the study of psychopathology. Our results show that there is a high correlation between the change of weight of low gamma band and the difference between HC, CHR and FES. If the features revised according to weights are used for reclassification, the accuracy of result will be improved compared with the original classifier, which confirms the role of the band weight distribution."

For iid real Gaussian channels with additive Gaussian noise, we obtain exact asymptotic expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) of the BRO. The formulas are particularly simple, they yield useful insights, and they allow accurate comparisons to the matched-filter bound (MFB) and to the zero-forcing decoder. For BPSK signals the SER performance of the BRO is within 3dB of the MFB for square systems, and it approaches the MFB as the number of receive antennas grows large compared to the number of transmit antennas.

However, the limited performance of the direct detection receiver technology currently used in the optical network units at the customers' premises restricts data rates/user. Therefore, the concept of coherent-enabled access networks has attracted attention in recent years, as this technology offers high receiver sensitivity, inherent frequency selectivity, and linear field detection enabling the full compensation of linear channel impairments. However, the complexity of conventional (dual-polarisation digital) coherent receivers has so far prevented their introduction into access networks. Thus, to exploit the benefits of coherent technology in the ONUs, low complexity coherent receivers, suitable for implementation in ONUs, are needed. In this paper, the recently proposed low complexity coherent (i.e., polarisation-independent Alamouti-coding heterodyne) receiver is, for the first time, compared in terms of its minimum receiver sensitivity with five previously reported receiver designs, including a detailed discussion on their advantages and limitations. It is shown that the Alamouti-coding based receiver approach allows the lowest number of photons per bit (PPB) transmitted (with a lower bound of 15.5 PPB in an ideal system simulations) whilst requiring the lowest optical receiver hardware complexity. It also exhibits comparable complexity to the currently deployed direct-detection receivers, which typically require >1000 PPB.

The low area and bandwidth requirements make the accelerator highly suitable for integration into SoCs where silicon area budget is constrained and external memory is typically a heavily contended resource."

"arXiv:1711.09386","Haitao Liu","eess.SP","With explosive growth of the mobile Internet access and the popularization of wireless local area network (WLAN) access points (APs), wireless fidelity (WiFi) offloading is considered as an important supplementary technique to reduce the load of cellular infrastructure and enhance quality of network service. In this paper, we design and implement the framework of LTEWiFi aggregation (LWA) which is in line with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) released standard recently. In the LWA system, the process of data offloading is different from that of WiFi interworking on the cellular core network. WLAN APs directly connect to eNodeBs (eNBs), and the offloading is realized in Packet Data Convergence Protocol layer (PDCP). Thus, this architecture makes full use of existed WLAN APs to improve the performance of indoor cellular network. Besides, benefiting from the flow control between LTE and WiFi, eNB schedule can be more flexible and efficient. Next, it is implemented based on open source OpenAirInterface (OAI) software defined radio (SDR) platform, where a simple and practical reordering method is proposed and carried out. Experimental results demonstrate that our design works stably with the WiFi-offloading and reordering functions."

These systems make use of the radio measurements of short-range commodity wireless devices, which vary due to the inhalation and exhalation motion of a person. The success of respiration rate estimation using such measurements depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, which alters with properties of the person and with the measurement system. To date, no model has been presented that allows evaluation of different deployments or system configurations for successful breathing rate estimation. In this paper, a received signal strength model for respiration rate monitoring is introduced. It is shown that measurements in linear and logarithmic scale have the same functional form, and the same estimation techniques can be used in both cases. The implications of the model are validated under varying signal-to-noise ratio conditions using the performances of three estimators: batch frequency estimator, recursive Bayesian estimator, and model-based estimator. The results are in coherence with the findings, and they imply that different estimators are advantageous in different signal-to-noise ratio regimes."

It is assumed that there are some sub-channels in each cell which should be allocated among some users. Also, each user is subjected to a power constraint. The underlying problem is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear optimization problem which does not have a trivial solution. To solve the problem, having fixed the consumed power of each user, and assuming low co-channel interference region, the sub-channel allocation problem is reformulate into a more mathematically tractable problem which is shown can be tackled through the so-called Hungarian algorithm. Then, the consumed power of each user is reformulated as a quadratic fractional problem which can be numerically derived.

Data acquired using these techniques can be analyzed in terms of its network structure to reveal organizing principles at the systems level. Graph representations are versatile models where nodes are associated to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Structural graphs model neural pathways in white matter that are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs are built based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise measure of statistical interdependency between activity traces of regions. Therefore, most research to date has focused on analyzing these graphs reflecting structure or function.  Graph signal processing (GSP) is an emerging area of research where signals recorded at the nodes of the graph are studied atop the underlying graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations have been generalized to the graph setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint. Here, we review GSP for brain imaging data and discuss their potential to integrate brain structure, contained in the graph itself, with brain function, residing in the graph signals. We review how brain activity can be meaningfully filtered based on concepts of spectral modes derived from brain structure. We also derive other operations such as surrogate data generation or decompositions informed by cognitive systems. In sum, GSP offers a novel framework for the analysis of brain imaging data."

Motivated by the success of auditory perception based techniques in speech signal classification, we represent time-frequency information of lung sounds using mel-scale warped spectral coefficients, called here as mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs). Next, we employ local binary pattern analysis (LBP) to capture texture information of the MFSCs, and the feature vectors are subsequently derived using histogram representation. The proposed features are used with three well-known classifiers in this field: k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Also, the performance was tested with multiple SVM kernels. We conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments using two databases which include normal and adventitious sounds. Results show that the proposed features with SVM and also with kNN classifier outperform commonly used wavelet-based features as well as our previously investigated mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) based statistical features, specifically in abnormal sound detection. Proposed features also yield better results than morphological features and energy features computed from rational dilation wavelet coefficients. The Bhattacharyya kernel performs considerably better than other kernels. Further, we optimize the configuration of the proposed feature extraction algorithm. Finally, we have applied mRMR (minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy) based feature selection method to remove redundancy in the feature vector which makes the proposed method computationally more efficient without any degradation in the performance.

"arXiv:1710.00623","Manuel Servin, Moises Padilla","eess.SP","Optical phase-modulated fringe-patterns are usually digitized with XxY pixels and 8 bits/pixel (or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are raw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy fringe-patterns store much less Shannon information than the capacity of the digitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras may waste to noise most bits/pixel. For example one would not use smartphone cameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images. However smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we show here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its (S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy H, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images may be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information phase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in spite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are redundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and data compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage. Shannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression algorithms. Here we show that phase-modulated phase-shifted fringes are highly correlated, and as a consequence, phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be used as fringe-data compressors. Therefore a PSA may compress a large number of phase-shifted fringes into a single complex-valued image. This is important in spaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by huge distance and low-power downlink. That is, instead of transmitting M phase-shifted fringes, one only transmit the phase-demodulated signal as compressed sensing data."

Killey, Polina Bayvel","eess.SP","The efficiency of digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) is analyzed in the presence of noise arising from amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) as well as from a non-ideal transceiver subsystem. Its impact on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split NLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between transmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's for non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations. When signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation arises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of nonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver noise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short transmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger transmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with respect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains. Additionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio and the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that split NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard single-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when transmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when transmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56% on top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations."

We develop both centralized and distributed transmission aware cache placement strategies to minimize users' average download delay subject to the storage capacity constraints. In the centralized mode, the cache placement problem is transformed into a matroid constrained submodular maximization problem, and an approximation algorithm is proposed to find a solution within a constant factor to the optimum. In the distributed mode, a belief propagation based distributed algorithm is proposed to provide a suboptimal solution, with iterative updates at each BS based on locally collected information.

Through parallel sampling branches, an MWC compresses a multiband spectrum by mixing it with PR signals in the time domain, and acquires its sub-Nyquist samples. Previously, the ratio of compression was fully dependent on the specifications of PR signals. That is, to further reduce the sampling rate without information loss, faster and longer-period PR signals were needed. However, the implementation of such PR signal generators results in high power consumption and large fabrication area. In this paper, we propose a novel aliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the sampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals. The main idea is to induce intentional signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In addition to the first spectral compression by the signal mixer, the intentional aliasing compresses the mixed spectrum once again. We demonstrate that AMWC reduces the number of sampling branches and the rate of ADC for lossless sub-Nyquist sampling without needing to upgrade the speed or period of PR signals. Conversely, for a given fixed number of sampling branches and sampling rate, AMWC improves the performance of signal reconstruction."

We evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an example application). Experimental results show that the cGAN method overall outperforms the classical short-time spectral amplitude minimum mean square error (STSA-MMSE) SE algorithm, and is comparable to a deep neural network-based SE approach (DNN-SE)."

We formulate the problem of finding a spectrum sensing policy for multi-band dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic restless multi-armed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward distributions. In cognitive radio networks the multi-armed bandit problem arises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies that could be efficiently exploited for data transmission. We consider two models for the dynamics of the frequency bands: 1) the independent model where the state of the band evolves randomly independently from the past and 2) the Gilbert-Elliot model, where the states evolve according to a 2-state Markov chain. It is shown that in these conditions the proposed sensing policy attains asymptotically logarithmic weak regret. The policy proposed in this paper is an index policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample mean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes spectrum exploitation whereas the exploration bonus encourages for further exploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency based approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it will grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a suboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing weak regret. Simulation results confirming logarithmic weak regret are presented and it is found that the proposed policy provides often improved performance at low complexity over other state-of-the-art policies in the literature."

"arXiv:1709.06342","Mai Xu, Chen Li, Zulin Wang, Zhenzhong Chen","eess.IV","In contrast with traditional video, panoramic video enables spherical viewing direction with support for head-mounted displays, providing an interactive and immersive experience. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are few visual quality assessment (VQA) methods, either subjective or objective, for panoramic video. This paper proposes both subjective and objective methods for assessing quality loss in impaired panoramic video. Specifically, we first establish a new database, which includes the viewing direction data from several subjects watching panoramic video sequences. Then, from our database, we find a high consistency in viewing direction across different subjects. The viewing directions are normally distributed in the center of the front regions, but they sometimes fall into other regions, related to video content. Given this finding, we present a subjective VQA method for measuring different mean opinion score (DMOS) of the whole and regional panoramic video, in terms of overall DMOS (O-DMOS) and vectorized DMOS (V-DMOS), respectively. Moreover, we propose two objective VQA methods for panoramic video, in light of human perception characteristics of panoramic video. One method weighs the distortion of pixels with regard to their distances to the center of front regions, which considers human preference in a panorama. The other method predicts viewing directions according to video content, and then the predicted viewing directions are leveraged to assign weights to the distortion of each pixel in our objective VQA method. Finally, our experimental results verify that both the subjective and objective methods proposed in this paper advance state-of-the-art VQA for panoramic video."

In a WSN, CS based techniques are well motivated by not only the sparsity prior but also by the requirement of energy efficient processing even with nonsparse signals. First, we address different forms of sparsity including temporal and spatial that are exhibited in WSNs. We discuss sparsity aware signal processing techniques exploiting such forms of sparsity in centralized as well as distributed/decentralized settings from signal reconstruction perspective. We then review recent research efforts that exploit CS to solve different types of inference problems such as detection, classification, and estimation where signal reconstruction is not necessary. We further review the work that takes practical considerations such as quantization, physical layer secrecy constraints, and imperfect channel conditions into account in the CS based signal processing framework. Finally, open research issues and challenges are discussed in order to provide perspectives for future research directions.

Biosignals are non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable tool to analyze them. It is well understood that Gaussian chirplet function is critical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet transform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well accepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to bio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that the power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been fully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In this paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the "coarse-refinement" scheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the matching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We emphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which is important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong background noise. We then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by applying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visual evoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and bat ultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. The results show that the MPEM algorithm provides more compact representation of signals under investigation and clearer visualization of their time-frequency structures, indicating considerable promise of ACT in biosignal analysis.

"arXiv:1709.07722","Daniel Verenzuela, Emil Björnson, Luca Sanguinetti","eess.SP","Next generation wireless networks aim at providing substantial improvements in spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Massive MIMO has been proved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE. To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a practical random BS deployment. We prove that the reduction of pilot contamination with SP is outweighed by the additional coherent and non-coherent interference. Numerical results show that when both methods are optimized, RP achieves comparable SE and EE to SP in practical scenarios."

However, it results in a poor resolution and high sidelobes. To address these challenges, a new algorithm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) was introduced having lower sidelobes compared to DAS. To improve the resolution of DMAS, a novel beamformer is introduced using Minimum Variance (MV) adaptive beamforming combined with DMAS, so-called Minimum Variance-Based DMAS (MVB-DMAS). It is shown that expanding the DMAS equation results in multiple terms representing a DAS algebra. It is proposed to use the MV adaptive beamformer instead of the existing DAS. MVB-DMAS is evaluated numerically and experimentally. In particular, at the depth of 45 mm MVB-DMAS results in about 31 dB, 18 dB and 8 dB sidelobes reduction compared to DAS, MV and DMAS, respectively. The quantitative results of the simulations show that MVB-DMAS leads to improvement in full-width-half-maximum about 96 %, 94 % and 45 % and signal-to-noise ratio about 89 %, 15 % and 35 % compared to DAS, DMAS, MV, respectively.

In practice, the mismatches in the radio frequency (RF) analog circuits among different antennas at the base station (BS) break the end-to-end UL and DL channel reciprocity. Antenna calibration is necessary to avoid the severe performance degradation with massive MIMO. Many calibration schemes are available to compensate the RF gain mismatches and restore the channel reciprocity in TDD massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we focus on the internal self-calibration scheme where different BS antennas are interconnected via hardware transmission lines. First, we study the resulting calibration performance for an arbitrary interconnection strategy. Next, we obtain closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expressions for each interconnection strategy at the BS with only (M-1) transmission lines and M denotes the total number of BS antennas. Basing on the derived results, we further prove that the star interconnection strategy is optimal for internal self-calibration due to its lowest CRLB. In addition, we also put forward efficient recursive algorithms to derive the corresponding maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of all the calibration coefficients.

"arXiv:1805.00165","Fernando Gama, Antonio G. Marques, Geert Leus, Alejandro Ribeiro","eess.SP","We describe two architectures that generalize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the processing of signals supported on graphs. The selection graph neural network (GNN) replaces linear time invariant filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes. A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The aggregation GNN diffuses the signal through the graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs is further introduced for operation in large scale graphs. An important property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a circulant graph. Comparative numerical analyses are performed in a synthetic source localization application. Performance is evaluated for a text category classification problem using word proximity networks. Multinode aggregation GNNs are consistently the best performing GNN architecture."

There is one fact that flicker of LED light should be avoid in any VLC systems. Current flicker mitigation solutions based on run-length limited (RLL) codes suffer from reduced code rates, or are limited to hard-decoding forward error correction (FEC) decoders. Recently, soft-decoding techniques of RLL-codes are proposed to support soft-decoding FEC algorithms, but they contain potentials of high-complexity and time-consuming computations. Fortunately, non-RLL direct current (DC)-balance solutions can overcome the drawbacks of RLL-based algorithms, however, they meet some difficulties in system latency or inferior error-correction performances. Recently, non-RLL flicker mitigation solution based on Polar code has proved to be an optimal approach due to its natural equal probabilities of short runs of 1's and 0's with high error-correction performance. However, we found that this solution can only maintain the DC balance only when the data frame length is sufficiently long. Accordingly, short beacon-based data frames might still be a big challenge for flicker mitigation in such non-RLL cases. In this paper, we introduce a flicker mitigation solution designed for VLC-based beacon systems that combines a simple pre-scrambler with a Polar encoder which has a codeword smaller than the previous work 8 times. We also propose a hardware architecture for the proposed compact non-RLL VLC receiver for the first time. Also, a 3-bit soft-decision filter is introduce to enable soft-decoding of Polar decoder to improve the performance of the receiver."

In the IT mode, a zero-forcing (ZF) beamformed signal with no interference to the destination is transmitted at the multi-antenna PB to supply wireless energy for the sources, and bring non-negative effect to the destination. Among multiple sources, the energy-sufficient source with the best channel quality is selected for wireless information transmission (WIT), while the other sources remain for energy harvesting. In the non-IT mode, the equal power transmission is adopted at PB to focus on energy delivery. Using Markov chain theory, the energy arrival and departure of each finite-capacity storage at the source is characterized mathematically, and the comprehensive analytical expressions of the energy outage probability (EOP), the connection outage probability (COP), and the average transmission delay (ATD) are formulated and derived.

Fingerprint-based methods, which compare location unique fingerprints collected beforehand with the fingerprint measured from the target, have attracted much attention recently in both of academia and industry. They have been successfully used for many location-based applications.From the viewpoint of practical applications, in this paper, four different typical approaches of fingerprint-based radio emitter localization system are introduced with four different representative applications: localization of LTE smart phone used for anti-cheating in exams, indoor localization of Wi-Fi terminals, localized light control in BEMS using location information of occupants, and illegal radio localization in outdoor environments. Based on the different practical application scenarios, different solutions, which are designed to enhance the localization performance, are discussed in detail. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to give a guideline for readers about fingerprint-based localization system in terms of fingerprint selection, hardware architecture design and algorithm enhancement"

"arXiv:1804.03068","Vinicius Ferraris, Nicolas Dobigeon, Marie Chabert","eess.IV","Unsupervised change detection techniques are generally constrained to two multi-band optical images acquired at different times through sensors sharing the same spatial and spectral resolution. This scenario is suitable for a straight comparison of homologous pixels such as pixel-wise differencing. However, in some specific cases such as emergency situations, the only available images may be those acquired through different kinds of sensors with different resolutions. Recently some change detection techniques dealing with images with different spatial and spectral resolutions, have been proposed. Nevertheless, they are focused on a specific scenario where one image has a high spatial and low spectral resolution while the other has a low spatial and high spectral resolution. This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes between any two multi-band optical images disregarding their spatial and spectral resolution disparities. We propose a method that effectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images as spatially and spectrally degraded versions of two (unobserved) latent images characterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. Covering the same scene, the latent images are expected to be globally similar except for possible changes in spatially sparse locations. Thus, the change detection task is envisioned through a robust fusion task which enforces the differences between the estimated latent images to be spatially sparse. We show that this robust fusion can be formulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved using an alternate minimization strategy. The proposed framework is implemented for an exhaustive list of applicative scenarios and applied to real multi-band optical images. A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the proposed robust fusion-based strategy."

"arXiv:1804.04431","Shuaishuai Guo, Ki-Hong Park, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","eess.SP","Digital pulse interval modulation (DPIM) is an advanced energy-efficient modulation techniques for optical wireless communications (OWC) based on intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD). DPIM requires no accurate symbol-level synchronization. It is capable of leveraging less slots to carry the same information as pulse position modulation (PPM) and thus more efficient than PPM. However, error propagation hampers the application of DPIM. Motivated by controlling error propagation, this paper proposes an ordered sequence detection (OSD) for DPIM. To detect a packet consisting of $L$-chips, the computational complexity of OSD is low, of the order $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$. Moreover, this paper also proposes a robust pulse interval modulation (RPIM) scheme with OSD. In RPIM, the last of every $K$ symbols is with more power to transmit information and simultaneously to provide a built-in synchronization signal. In this way, error propagation is bounded in a slot of $K$ symbols. Together with interleaver and forward error correction (FEC) code, the bit error rate (BER) can be greatly reduced. We derive the approximate uncoded BER performance of conventional DPIM with OSD and the newly proposed RPIM with OSD based on order statistic theory. We calculate the optimal power allocation in every $K$ symbol slots minimizing the uncoded BER by using a bisection search algorithm. Simulations are conducted to collaborate on theoretical analysis. Optimal parameter settings are also investigated in uncoded and coded systems by simulations. Simulation results show that RPIM with OSD considerably outperforms existing DPIM with optimal threshold detection in either uncoded or coded systems over various channels."

It has become important to obtain performance measures for such communication systems to quantify their efficacy. The fundamental advantage of using a vector sensor as a receiver is that a single sensor is able to provide diversity gains offered by MIMO systems. In a recent work novel framework for evaluating capacity of underwater channel was proposed. The approach is based on modeling the channel as a set of paths along which the signal arrives at the receiver with different Angles of Arrival. In this work, we build on that framework to provide a bound on the achievable capacity of such a system. The analytical bounds have been compared against simulation results for a vector sensor based SIMO underwater communications system. The channel parameters are modeled by analysing the statistics generated with Bellhop simulation tool. This representation of the channel is flexible and allows for characterizing channels at differenet geographical locations and at different time instances. This characterization in terms of channel parameters enables the computing of the performance measure (channel capacity bound) for different geographical locations"

We construct a convex optimization problem using a relaxed support constraint and a maximum-likelihood treatment of the recorded data as a sample from the underlying wave function.

We introduce a phone usage classification based on the network access modes, e.g., voice (circuit switched) or nonvoice (packet switched) services, and the use of accessories such as wired or Bluetooth handsets, or a speaker-phone during the network access session. The random phone orientation is then modelled by the spherical von Mises-Fisher distribution for each of the identified phone usage types. A finite mixture model based on the individual probability distribution functions and heuristic weights is also presented. The models are based on data collected from built-in accelerometer measurements. Our approach offers a straightforward modeling of the user-induced random orientation for different phone usage types.

In such a system, the precoding problem plays a central role as the precoded symbols are affected by extra distortion introduced by 1-bit DACs. In this paper, we develop a highly-efficient nonlinear precoding algorithm based on the alternative direction method framework. Unlike the classic algorithms, such as the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) algorithms, which solve convex relaxed versions of the original precoding problem, the new algorithm solves the original nonconvex problem directly. The new algorithm is guaranteed to globally converge under some mild conditions. A sufficient condition for its convergence has been derived. Experimental results in various conditions demonstrated that, the new algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to the SDR algorithm, while being much more efficient (more than 300 times faster than the SDR algorithm)."

We derive the optimality condition for bit allocation under a power constraint. This condition ensures optimal receiver performance in the Mean Squared Error (MSE) sense. We derive the MSE expression and show that it approaches the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). The CRLB is seen to be a function of the analog combiner, the digital combiner, and the bit allocation matrix. We attempt to minimize the CRLB with respect to the bit allocation matrix by making suitable assumptions regarding the structure of the combiners. In doing so, the bit allocation design reduces to a set of simple inequalities consisting of ADC bits, channel singular values and covariance of the quantization noise along each RF path. This results in a simple and computationally efficient bit allocation algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the MSE performance of our proposed bit allocation is very close to that of the Full Search (FS) bit allocation.

We then show that this multi-layer construction admits a brand new interpretation in a unique symbiosis between synthesis and analysis models: while the deepest layer indeed provides a synthesis representation, the mid-layers decompositions provide an analysis counterpart. This new perspective exposes the suboptimality of previously proposed pursuit approaches, as they do not fully leverage all the information comprised in the model constraints. Armed with this understanding, we address fundamental theoretical issues, revisiting previous analysis and expanding it. Motivated by the limitations of previous algorithms, we then propose an integrated - holistic - alternative that estimates all representations in the model simultaneously, and analyze all these different schemes under stochastic noise assumptions. Inspired by the synthesis-analysis duality, we further present a Holistic Pursuit algorithm, which alternates between synthesis and analysis sparse coding steps, eventually solving for the entire model as a whole, with provable improved performance.

This occurs if the input signal is characterized by a large signal-to-noise ratio resulting in the deterministic component of the quantization error dominating the random error component and when the ADC transition levels are not uniformly distributed over the quantizer input range. In this paper, it is first shown that the LSE applied to quantized data does not perform as expected when the quantizer is not uniform. Then, an estimator is introduced that overcomes these limitations. It uses the values of the transition levels so that a prior quantizer calibration phase is necessary. The estimator properties are analyzed and both numerical and experimental results are described to illustrate its performance. It is shown that the described estimator outperforms the LSE and it also provides an estimate of the probability distribution function of the noise before quantization."

This paper proposes a method denoted by block sparse MlEC (BlS MlEC) in order to exploit between-lead correlations to compress the signals in a more efficient way. This is due to the fact that multi-lead ECG signals are multiple observations of the same source (heart) from different locations. Consequently, they have high correlation in terms of the support set of their sparse models which leads them to share dominant common structure. In order to obtain the block sparse model, the collaborative version of lasso estimator is applied. In addition, we have shown that raised cosine kernel has advantages over conventional Gaussian and wavelet (Daubechies family) due to its specific properties. It is demonstrated that using raised cosine kernel in constructing the sparsifying basis matrix gives a sparser model which results in higher compression ratio and lower reconstruction error.

This paper proposes a mixing model that explicitly incorporates a hierarchical structure of redundant multiple spectra representing each class. The proposed method is designed to promote sparsity on the selection of both spectra and classes within each pixel. The resulting unmixing algorithm is able to adaptively recover several bundles of endmember spectra associated with each class and robustly estimate abundances. In addition, its flexibility allows a variable number of classes to be present within each pixel of the hyperspectral image to be unmixed.

Both destination and eavesdropper take advantage of the direct and relayed transmissions through maximal ratio diversity combining. The secrecy outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate are derived in closed-form for different channel state information (CSI) availability. It was observed that when the required rate is low, having CSI knowledge is more advantageous than in the case of higher rate. An increase in the required threshold SNR at the relay can increase the SOP if the relayed link SNR is relatively higher than the direct link SNR. It was also shown that SOP cannot be improved beyond a certain value when keeping either dual-hop link average SNR fixed and increasing the other link SNR, whereas the ergodic secrecy rate can be increased by keeping the source to destination average SNR fixed."

Sine reference signals are digitally down-converted to baseband for the analysis of phase deviations. Hereby, we compare the precision of the fixed-point hardware Digital Signal Processing chain with a custom Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) x86 floating-point implementation. Pulse reference signals are analyzed by a software trigger that precisely locates the time where the slope passes a certain threshold. The measurement system is implemented and verified using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 by Ettus Research LLC. Applying standard 10 MHz and 1 PPS reference signals for testing, a measurement precision (standard deviation) of 0.36 ps and 16.6 ps is obtained, respectively. In connection with standard PC hardware, the system allows long-term acquisition and storage of measurement data over several weeks. A comparison is given to the Dual Mixer Time Difference (DMTD) and Time Interval Counter (TIC), which are state-of-the-art measurement methods for sine and pulse signal analysis, respectively. Furthermore, we show that our proposed USRP-based approach outperforms measurements with a high-grade Digital Sampling Oscilloscope."

Ramya","eess.SP","This paper presents a design of efficient smart jammer to jam the 4G signals, specifically band 3 and band 40 which can be predominantly used in India. The MATLAB Simulink tool was used for the analysis of the circuit design. Simulink, an advanced tool gives accurate results comparable to real-time analysis. The DSP toolbox of the Simulink library has been largely used to construct and view the results of the model. The main objective of this paper is to receive the LTE signals, filter band 3 and band 40, add noise and increase the amplitude of the signal. The uniqueness of this design is the use of full wave rectifier in the circuit and the trigger enabled blocks. Full wave rectifier with added circuitry acts as a trigger to the jammer which contains the noise block and the gain block. Sine wave generators were used to replicate real-time signals and additional signals were added as noise. The advantage of the design is when none of the bands are detected, the output will not be generated, thus saving power. The incorporation of the detector circuit and trigger circuit ensures that power is not wasted by the jamming circuit when the signal is not detected. These jammers can be used in examination halls, conference halls and in secure location where telecommunication signals are unwanted."

At present, disparate methods exist for steady-state analysis of the transmission (power flow) and distribution power grid (three-phase power flow). All existing alternating current (AC) power flow and three-phase power flow analyses formulate a non-linear problem that generally lacks the ability to ensure convergence to the correct physical solution from an arbitrary set of initial guesses. In this paper, we demonstrate that our equivalent circuit formulation approach can model both the positive sequence model of the transmission grid and three-phase model of the distribution grid without loss of generality. Moreover, when combined with novel circuit simulation techniques, it can robustly solve for the steady-state solution for both these network models independent of the choice of initial conditions. Examples for positive sequence transmission and three-phase distribution systems, including 75k+ nodes Eastern Interconnection transmission test cases and 8k+ nodes taxonomy distribution test cases, are solved from arbitrary initial guesses to demonstrate the robustness of our approach."

Bovik","eess.IV","Automatically assessing perceptual video quality reliably and without access to a reference video is crucial for many video processing applications that involve acquisition, streaming, compression, and enhancement. The very large ranges of skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current no-reference (NR), video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by only a few videographers and have been subjected to only a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under various imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often poorly perform. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction to be able to handle wide varieties of real-world videos, we have constructed a large-scale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, and wide ranges of realistic quality levels including complex, authentic distortions. We were able to collect a large number of subjective video quality scores by crowdsourcing them on Amazon Mechanical Turk. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the completed study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores. Recognizing the larger range of distortions affecting videos (than pictures) and the likelihood of wider spreads of human quality judgments, we obtained an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video."

By utilizing the co-array, a sparse array can match the performance of a uniform array, despite having significantly fewer sensors. However, even sparse arrays may have many closely spaced elements, which can deteriorate the array performance through mutual coupling. This paper proposes a novel sparse planar array with very few unit element displacements for reducing mutual coupling. This Concentric Rectangular Array (CRA) is designed for active sensing tasks, such as radar and medical ultrasound, in which the same elements are used for both transmission and reception. The properties of the CRA are compared to two established sparse arrays: the Boundary Array and the Minimum-Redundancy Array (MRA).

It is particularly difficult to identify the sources of transient RFI, which is broadband and intermittent. Such RFI is often generated by devices like mechanical relays, fluorescent lighting or AC machines, which may be present in the surrounding infrastructure of a radio telescope array. One mitigating approach is to deploy independent RFI monitoring stations at radio telescope arrays. Once the sources of RFI signals are identified, they may be removed or replaced where possible. For the first time in the open literature, we demonstrate an approach to classifying the sources of transient RFI (in time domain data) that makes use of deep learning techniques including CNNs and LSTMs. Applied to a previously obtained dataset of experimentally recorded transient RFI signals, our proposed approach offers good results. It shows potential for development into a tool for identifying the sources of transient RFI signals recorded by independent RFI monitoring stations."
"arXiv:1803.02695","Donnacha Daly, Didier Sornette","eess.SP","This work revisits a class of biomimetically inspired log-periodic waveforms first introduced by R.A. Altes in the 1970s for generalized target description. It was later observed that there is a close connection between such sonar techniques and wavelet decomposition for multiresolution analysis. Motivated by this, we formalize the original Altes waveforms as a family of hyperbolic chirplets suitable for the detection of accelerating time-series oscillations. The formalism results in a remarkably flexible set of wavelets with desirable properties of admissibility, regularity, vanishing moments, and time-frequency localization. These "Altes wavelets" also facilitate efficient implementation of the scale invariant hyperbolic chirplet transform (HCT).  From a practical perspective, log-periodic oscillations with an acceleration towards criticality can serve as indicators of an incipient bifurcation. Such signals abound in nature, often as precursors to phase transitions in the non-linear dynamics of complex systems. For example, the authors' interest lies in automatic detection of the well documented phenomenon of log-periodic price dynamics during financial bubbles and preceding market crashes. However, the methodology presented here is more widely applicable in such diverse domains as prediction of critical failures in mechanical systems, and fault detection in electrical networks. Examples beyond failure diagnostics include animal species identification via call recordings, commercial \& military radar, and there are many more.

The coding structure of a GF group is fixed with a given GF group size. In the current AOM/AV1 encoder, video frames are coded using a hierarchical, multilayer coding structure within one GF group. It has been observed that the use of multilayer coding structure may result in worse coding performance if the GF group presents consistent stillness across its frames. This paper proposes a new approach that adaptively designs the Golden-Frame (GF) group coding structure through the use of stillness detection. Our new approach hence develops an automatic stillness detection scheme using three metrics extracted from each GF group. It then differentiates those GF groups of stillness from other non- still GF groups and uses different GF coding structures accordingly.

Many of the proposed fire detection algorithms in a still image are prone to false alarms caused by objects with a colour similar to fire. To design a colour-based system with a better false alarm rate, a new colour-differentiating conversion matrix, efficient on images of high colour complexity, is proposed. The elements of this conversion matrix are obtained by performing K-medoids clustering and Particle Swarm Optimisation procedures on a fire sample image with a background of high fire-colour similarity. The proposed conversion matrix is then used to construct two new fire colour detection frameworks. The first detection method is a two-stage non-linear image transformation framework, while the second is a direct transformation of an image with the proposed conversion matrix. A performance comparison of the proposed methods with alternate methods in the literature was carried out. Experimental results indicate that the linear image transformation method outperforms other methods regarding false alarm rate while the non-linear two-stage image transformation method has the best performance on the F-score metric and provides a better trade-off between missed detection and false alarm rate."

Energy detection is one of the most used techniques for spectrum sensing because it does not require any prior information about the characteristics of the primary user signal. However, this technique does not distinguish between the signal and the noise. It has a low performance at low SNR, and the selection of the threshold becomes an issue because the noise is uncertain. The detection performance of this technique can be further improved using a dynamic selection of the sensing threshold. In this work, we investigate a dynamic selection of this threshold by measuring the power of noise present in the received signal using a blind technique. The proposed model was implemented and tested using GNU Radio software and USRP units. Our results show that the dynamic selection of the threshold based on measuring the noise level present in the received signal during the detection process increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false alarm compared to the ones of energy detection with a static threshold."

As a result, a key challenge for designing SC accelerators is manipulating the impact of correlation across SC operations. This paper presents and evaluates a set of novel correlation manipulating circuits to manage correlation in SC computation: a synchronizer, desynchronizer, and decorrelator. We then use these circuits to propose improved SC maximum, minimum, and saturating adder designs.

The presented analysis considers the impact of the energy constraint on users' preferences and the BS's revenue. In order to model the competitive nature of the problem, game theory is used. The next two chapters focus on wireless powered networks (WPNs) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) using radio frequency (RF) technology. One of the main contributions of these chapters is the introduction of both uplink and downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for WPNs. Moreover, the individual data rates and fairness are improved, while the formulated problems are optimally and efficiently solved. It is shown that, compared to orthogonal multiple access, NOMA offers a considerable improvement in throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. Rather than this, proportional fairness is maximized and uplink/downlink of WPNs are jointly optimized, in which cases, except for NOMA, time division multiple access (TDMA) is also investigated. Furthermore, the role of interference is considered, which has been recognized as one of the main reasons of the asymmetric overall degradation of the users' performance, due to different path-loss values, called from now on as cascaded near-far problem.

The sheer variety of anomalous events necessitates adopting cognitive anomaly detection methods instead of the traditional signature-based detection techniques. This paper proposes an anomaly detection methodology for wireless systems that is based on monitoring and analyzing radio frequency (RF) spectrum activities. Our detection technique leverages an existing solution for the video prediction problem, and uses it on image sequences generated from monitoring the wireless spectrum. The deep predictive coding network is trained with images corresponding to the normal behavior of the system, and whenever there is an anomaly, its detection is triggered by the deviation between the actual and predicted behavior. For our analysis, we use the images generated from the time-frequency spectrograms and spectral correlation functions of the received RF signal. We test our technique on a dataset which contains anomalies such as jamming, chirping of transmitters, spectrum hijacking, and node failure, and evaluate its performance using standard classifier metrics: detection ratio, and false alarm rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively detects many unforeseen anomalous events in real time.

Such model captures the frequency dependence of transmission lines and cables, it is non-linear due to the constant power behavior of the converter terminals using droop regulation, and presents a suitable degree of simplifications of the MMC converters, under given conditions, to allow system level studies over potentially large networks. Based on this model, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point is demonstrated by returning the analysis to a load-flow problem and using the Banach fixed point theorem. Additionally, the stability of the equilibrium is analyzed by obtaining a Lyapunov function by the Krasovskii's theorem. Computational results obtained for the selected 4 terminals MT-HVDC grid corroborate the requirement for the existence and stability of the equilibrium point."

In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of the Ad-PAC algorithm are adapted based on the results of segmentation in previous frames. The Ad-PAC algorithm is applied to 65 ultrasound videos captured from 13 healthy subjects, with each video containing 450 frames. The results show that spatial and temporal adaptation of the energy function significantly improves segmentation performance when compared to current state-of-the-art active contour algorithms."
"arXiv:1803.07297","Pol Henarejos","eess.SP","Radiocommunication systems have evolved significantly in recent years in order to meet present and future demands. Historically, time, frequency and more recently, spatial dimensions have been used to improve capacity and robustness. Paradoxically, radiocommunications that leverage the polarization dimension have not evolved at the same pace. In particular, these communications are widely used by satellites, where several streams are multiplexed in each orthogonal polarization. Current communication trends advocate for simplifying and unifying different frameworks in order to increase flexibility and address future needs. Due to this, systems that do not require channel information are progressively gaining traction. This dissertation aims at challenging this perspective and promoting the use of polarization in new radiocommunication systems. Consequently, the goal of this thesis is twofold: first, we aim at increasing the current capacity of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links. Secondly, we introduce new mechanisms to increase the robustness of communications in particularly hostile environments. In this context, this thesis advocates for the use of polarization as a dimension to be exploited in radiocommunications. In addition to the use of polarization, index modulations help increase transmission rates whilst improving robustness against errors and imperfections with a low computational complexity. Thus, the study of polarization in these systems is essential. This dissertation explores primordial aspects in this area, such as channel capacity, transmitter and receiver design and performance benchmarking with current systems. Finally, we identify and discuss various characteristic aspects of polarization.

Also, a detailed analysis of the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh, Rice and Nakagami-$m$ channel distributions is provided. As application of the capacity analysis, we leverage the proposed expressions to compute the ergodic capacities of SMod for different antenna configuration and correlations, PMod for different channel components and conditions, and FMod for different frequency separations."

In this paper we study a system which uses simultaneously two orthogonal polarizations in order to communicate with the users. The application of MIMO signal processing techniques along with Adaptive Coding and Modulation in the forward link can provide remarkable throughput gains up to 100 % when compared with the single polarization system. The gateway is allowed to vary the MIMO and Modulation and Coding Schemes for each frame. The selection is done by means of a link adaptation algorithm which uses a tunable margin to achieve a prede ned target Frame Error Rate."

Although polarization has been deployed from the beginning in satellite communications, nowadays it is being exploited to increase the throughput of satellite links. More precisely, the application of diversity techniques to the polarization domain may provide reliable, robust, and fast satellite communications. Better and more flexible spectrum use is also possible if transmission and reception can take place simultaneously in close or even overlapping frequency bands. In this paper we investigate novel signal processing techniques to increase the throughput of satellite communications in fixed and mobile scenarios. First, we investigate four-dimensional (4D) constellations for the forward link. Second, we focus on the mobile scenario and introduce an adaptive algorithm which selects the optimal tuple of modulation order, coding rate, and MIMO scheme that maximizes the throughput constraint to a maximum packet error rate. Finally, we describe the operation of radio transceivers which cancel actively the self-interference posed by the transmit signal when operating in full-duplex mode."

"arXiv:1803.09946","Toru Nakashika, Shinji Takaki, Junichi Yamagishi","eess.AS","This paper describes a novel energy-based probabilistic distribution that represents complex-valued data and explains how to apply it to direct feature extraction from complex-valued spectra. The proposed model, the complex-valued restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), is designed to deal with complex-valued visible units as an extension of the well-known restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Like the RBM, the CRBM learns the relationships between visible and hidden units without having connections between units in the same layer, which dramatically improves training efficiency by using Gibbs sampling or contrastive divergence (CD). Another important characteristic is that the CRBM also has connections between real and imaginary parts of each of the complex-valued visible units that help represent the data distribution in the complex domain. In speech signal processing, classification and generation features are often based on amplitude spectra (e.g., MFCC, cepstra, and mel-cepstra) even if they are calculated from complex spectra, and they ignore phase information. In contrast, the proposed feature extractor using the CRBM directly encodes the complex spectra (or another complex-valued representation of the complex spectra) into binary-valued latent features (hidden units). Since the visible-hidden connections are undirected, we can also recover (decode) the complex spectra from the latent features directly. Our speech coding experiments demonstrated that the CRBM outperformed other speech coding methods, such as methods using the conventional RBM, the mel-log spectrum approximate (MLSA) decoder, etc."
"arXiv:1803.07220","Xuelu Li, Vishal Monga","eess.IV","Feature extraction from infrared (IR) images remains a challenging task. Learning based methods that can work on raw imagery/patches have therefore assumed significance. We propose a novel multi-task extension of the widely used sparse-representation-classification (SRC) method in both single and multi-view set-ups. That is, the test sample could be a single IR image or images from different views. When expanded in terms of a training dictionary, the coefficient matrix in a multi-view scenario admits a sparse structure that is not easily captured by traditional sparsity-inducing measures such as the $l_0$-row pseudo norm. To that end, we employ collaborative spike and slab priors on the coefficient matrix, which can capture fairly general sparse structures. Our work involves joint parameter and sparse coefficient estimation (JPCEM) which alleviates the need to handpick prior parameters before classification. The experimental merits of JPCEM are substantiated through comparisons with other state-of-art methods on a challenging mid-wave IR image (MWIR) ATR database made available by the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate."

The main contribution of this paper is a simple closed-form expression for generalized barycentric coordinates, which extends existing algorithms from two to n dimensions and allows arbitrary anchor-node configurations. The result relies on a connection between the Cayley-Menger bi-determinants of subsets of n+1 neighbor nodes and the signed volume of the simplices defined by these neighbor nodes. Hence, for noise-free measurements, the proposed method computes the optimal sensor network embedding as the solution of a linear system with coefficients obtained from the generalized barycentric node coordinates. Using simulations, we provide comparisons with DILOC and Matlab's MDS implementation. We also show that it is possible to improve our algorithm run time using fewer subsets of neighbor nodes."

Impact of dc input ripple on the output ripple for a Series Resonant Converter (SRC) using discrete domain exact discretization modelling method is analysed in this paper. A novel discrete state space model along with a small signal model for SRC considering 3 state variables is presented. The audiosusceptibility (AS) transfer function which relates the input to output ripple is derived from the small signal model. Analysis of the AS transfer function indicates a resonance peak and an expression is derived connecting the AS resonance frequency for input ripple with different SRC component values. Further analysis is done to show that a set of values for SRC parameter exists, which forms a design region, for which the normalized gain offered by the SRC for input ripple is less than unity at any input ripple frequency. A test setup to introduce the variable frequency ripple at the input of SRC for the experimental evaluation of AS transfer function is also proposed. Influence of stray parameters on AS gain, AS resonance frequency and on SRC tank resonance frequency is addressed. An SRC is designed at a power level of 10kW.

However, many samples can not be analyzed with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio because of the radiation damage induced by the electron beam. This is particularly crucial for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) which acquires spectral-spatial data and requires high beam intensity. Since scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) are able to acquire data cubes by scanning the electron probe over the sample and recording a spectrum for each spatial position, it is possible to design the scan pattern and to sample only specific pixels. As a consequence, partial acquisition schemes are now conceivable, provided a reconstruction of the full data cube is conducted as a post-processing step. This paper proposes two reconstruction algorithms for multi-band images acquired by STEM-EELS which exploits the spectral structure and the spatial smoothness of the image. The performance of the proposed schemes is illustrated thanks to experiments conducted on a realistic phantom dataset as well as real EELS spectrum-images."

Both offline and online scenarios are considered in the second step of DTER. To solve the nonlinear optimization problem of the offline scenario, we convert the design of offline optimal energy requesting problem into a classic shortest path problem and thus a global optimal solution can be obtained through dynamic programming (DP) algorithms.

To further explore the advantage of unlicensed bands, in this context the operation of both uplink and downlink has been supported and studied in the subsequent releases. However, it has been identified that scheduled uplink transmission performance in unlicensed spectrum is significantly degraded due to the double listen-before-talk (LBT) requirements at both eNB when sending the uplink grant, and at the scheduled UEs before transmission. In this paper, in order to overcome this issue, a novel uplink transmission scheme, which does not require any grant, is proposed, and the details regarding the system design are provided. By modeling the dynamics in time of the LBT for both a system that employs a conventional uplink scheme, as well as the proposed scheme, it is verified through analytical evaluation that the double LBT scheme for uplink transmission greatly reduces the channel access probability for the UE, and leads consequently to performance loss, while the proposed scheme is able to alleviate this issue. System level simulation results, compliant with the LTE standard, show that the proposed scheme can achieve a significant performance gain in terms of throughput with negligible performance loss for the downlink, and other technologies operating in the same spectrum."

Stability of RBD algorithms has also been verified in various correlation conditions.

However, manual analysis of EEG data requires highly trained clinicians, and is a procedure that is known to have relatively low inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and the rate at which new data becomes available make manual interpretation a time-consuming, resource-hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated analysis of EEG data offers the potential to improve the quality of patient care by shortening the time to diagnosis and reducing manual error. In this paper, we focus on one of the first steps in interpreting an EEG session - identifying whether the brain activity is abnormal or normal. To solve this task, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture termed ChronoNet which is inspired by recent developments from the field of image classification and designed to work efficiently with EEG data. ChronoNet is formed by stacking multiple 1D convolution layers followed by deep gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers where each 1D convolution layer uses multiple filters of exponentially varying lengths and the stacked GRU layers are densely connected in a feed-forward manner. We used the recently released TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus dataset for evaluating the performance of ChronoNet. Unlike previous studies using this dataset, ChronoNet directly takes time-series EEG as input and learns meaningful representations of brain activity patterns. ChronoNet outperforms the previously reported best results by 7.79% thereby setting a new benchmark for this dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate the domain-independent nature of ChronoNet by successfully applying it to classify speech commands."

It is shown that there is a summation procedure between the weighted subarrays in the output of the MV beamformer. This summation can be interpreted as the non-adaptive DAS beamformer. It is proposed to replace the existing DAS with the MV algorithm to reduce the contribution of the off-axis signals caused by the DAS beamformer between the weighted subarrays. The numerical results show that the proposed technique improves the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for about 28.83 μm and 4.8 dB in average, respectively, compared to MV beamformer. Also, quantitative evaluation of the experimental results indicates that the proposed D-MV leads to 0.15 mm and 1.96 dB improvement in FWHM and SNR, in comparison with MV beamformer."
"arXiv:1802.02241","Yue Wu, Youzuo Lin, Zheng Zhou, Andrew Delorey","eess.SP","One of the risks of large-scale geologic carbon sequestration is the potential migration of fluids out of the storage formations. Accurate and fast detection of this fluids migration is not only important but also challenging, due to the large subsurface uncertainty and complex governing physics. Traditional leakage detection and monitoring techniques rely on geophysical observations including seismic. However, the resulting accuracy of these methods is limited because of indirect information they provide requiring expert interpretation, therefore yielding in-accurate estimates of leakage rates and locations. In this work, we develop a novel machine-learning detection package, named "Seismic-Net", which is based on the deep densely connected neural network. To validate the performance of our proposed leakage detection method, we employ our method to a natural analog site at Chimayó, New Mexico. The seismic events in the data sets are generated because of the eruptions of geysers, which is due to the leakage of $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{2}$. In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of our Seismic-Net by formulating our detection problem as an event detection problem with time series data. A fixed-length window is slid throughout the time series data and we build a deep densely connected network to classify each window to determine if a geyser event is included. Through our numerical tests, we show that our model achieves precision/recall as high as 0.889/0.923. Therefore, our Seismic-Net has a great potential for detection of $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{2}$ leakage."
"arXiv:1802.03457","Fatima Salahdine, Naima Kaabouch, Hassan El Ghazi","eess.SP","For wideband spectrum sensing, compressive sensing has been proposed as a solution to speed up the high dimensional signals sensing and reduce the computational complexity. Compressive sensing consists of acquiring the essential information from a sparse signal and recovering it at the receiver based on an efficient sampling matrix and a reconstruction technique. In order to deal with the uncertainty, improve the signal acquisition performance, and reduce the randomness during the sensing and reconstruction processes, compressive sensing requires a robust sampling matrix and an efficient reconstruction technique. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines the advantages of a Circulant matrix with Bayesian models. This approach is implemented, extensively tested, and its results have been compared to those of l1 norm minimization with a Circulant or random matrix based on several metrics. These metrics are Mean Square Error, reconstruction error, correlation, recovery time, sampling time, and processing time. The results show that our technique is faster and more efficient."

The proposed method is computationally much faster than the existing wavelet packet based thresholding methods. A custom thresholding function based on a combination of mu-law and semisoft thresholding functions is designed and exploited to apply the statistically derived threshold upon the PWP coefficients. The proposed custom thresholding function works as a mu-law or a semisoft thresholding function or their combination based on the probability of speech presence and absence in a subband of the PWP transformed noisy speech. By using the speech files available in NOIZEUS database, a number of simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for speech signals in the presence of Gaussian white and street noises.

The first step is based on noise compensation on short time magnitude and the second step is based on phase compensation. The magnitude spectrum is compensated based on a modified spectral subtraction method where the cross-terms containing spectra of noise and clean speech are taken into consideration, which are neglected in the traditional spectral subtraction methods. By employing the modified magnitude and unchanged phase, a procedure is formulated to compensate the overestimation or underestimation of noise by phase compensation method based on the probability of speech presence. A modified complex spectrum based on these two steps are obtained to synthesize a musical noise free enhanced speech. Extensive simulations are carried out using the speech files available in the NOIZEUS database in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Certain techniques allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However, in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation of higher-level notions, such as topological features , in order to provide guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or acquired data sets. We also provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation of our approach for reproduction purposes."

We consider that a cognitive/secondary UAV transmitter communicates with a ground secondary receiver (SR), in the presence of a number of primary terrestrial communication links that operate over the same frequency band. We exploit the UAV's controllable mobility via trajectory design, to improve the cognitive UAV communication performance while controlling the co-channel interference at each of the primary receivers (PRs). In particular, we maximize the average achievable rate from the UAV to the SR over a finite mission/communication period by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and transmit power allocation, subject to constraints on the UAV's maximum speed, initial/final locations, and average transmit power, as well as a set of interference temperature (IT) constraints imposed at each of the PRs for protecting their communications. However, the joint trajectory and power optimization problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm that ensures to obtain a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA).

However, the performance of current practice is limited due to the heavy reliance on the environmental conditions as well as complex environmental noises. A non-time-series method suffers from the issue of solar radiation reflected by the target during heating stage, and issues of potential non-uniform heat distribution. These limitations are the major constraints of the traditional single thermal image method. Time series-based methods such as Fourier transform-based pulse phase thermography, principle component thermography, and high order statistics have been reported with robust results on surface reflective property difference and non-uniform heat distribution under the experimental setting. This paper aims to compare the performance of above methods to that of the conventional static thermal imaging method. The case used for the comparison is to detect voids in a hollow concrete block during the heating phase. The result was quantitatively evaluated by using Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

In many applications, however, the assumption that the reference image is of high quality may be untrue, leading to incorrect perceptual quality predictions. To address this, we propose a new two-step image quality prediction approach which integrates both no-reference (NR) and full-reference perceptual quality measurements into the quality prediction process. The no-reference module accounts for the possibly imperfect quality of the source (reference) image, while the full-reference component measures the quality differences between the source image and its possibly further distorted version. A simple, yet very efficient, multiplication step fuses the two sources of information into a reliable objective prediction score. We evaluated our two-step approach on a recently designed subjective image database and achieved standout performance compared to full-reference approaches, especially when the reference images were of low quality.

Since beacon transmission is the first step in starting the association process in Wi-Fi, we define association fairness as how fair LTE-U is in allowing Wi-Fi to start transmitting beacons on a channel that it occupies with a very large duty cycle. According to the LTE-U specification, if a LTE-U base station determines that a channel is vacant, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF for only 1 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 95%. In an area with heavy spectrum usage, there will be cases when a Wi-Fi access point wishes to share the same channel, as it does today with Wi-Fi. We study, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect that such a large LTE-U duty cycle can have on the association process, specifically Wi-Fi beacon transmission and reception. We demonstrate via an experimental set-up using National Instrument (NI) USRPs that a significant percentage of Wi-Fi beacons will either not be transmitted in a timely fashion or will not be received at the LTE-U BS thus making it difficult for the LTE-U BS to adapt its duty cycle in response to the Wi-Fi usage. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical analysis. We compare the results with Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence and demonstrate that LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence is not fair when it comes to initial association since there is a much larger percentage of beacon errors in the latter case. Hence, the results in the paper indicate that in order to maintain association fairness, a LTE-U BS should not transmit at such high duty cycles, even if it deems the channel to be vacant."

The GAA is able to combine traffic flow theory with neural networks and thus improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation. It consists of two Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM NNs) which capture correlation in time and space among traffic flow and traffic density. One of the LSTM NNs, called a discriminative network, aims to maximize the probability of assigning correct labels to both true traffic state matrices (i.e., traffic flow and traffic density within a given spatial-temporal area) and the traffic state matrices generated from the other neural network. The other LSTM NN, called a generative network, aims to generate traffic state matrices which maximize the probability that the discriminative network assigns true labels to them. The two LSTM NNs are trained simultaneously such that the trained generative network can generate traffic matrices similar to those in the training data set. Given a traffic state matrix with missing values, we use back-propagation on three defined loss functions to map the corrupted matrix to a latent space. The mapping vector is then passed through the pre-trained generative network to estimate the missing values of the corrupted matrix. The proposed GAA is compared with the existing Bayesian network approach on loop detector data collected from Seattle, Washington and that collected from San Diego, California. Experimental results indicate that the GAA can achieve higher accuracy in traffic state estimation than the Bayesian network approach."

Conventional digital predistortion (DPD) schemes use high-order polynomials to accurately approximate and compensate for the nonlinearity of the PA. This is not practical for scaling to tens or hundreds of PAs in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. There is more than one candidate precoding matrix in a massive MIMO system because of the excess degrees-of-freedom (DoFs), and each precoding matrix requires a different DPD polynomial order to compensate for the PA nonlinearity. This paper proposes a low-order DPD method achieved by exploiting massive DoFs of next-generation front ends. We propose a novel indirect learning structure which adapts the channel and PA distortion iteratively by cascading adaptive zero forcing precoding and DPD.

We consider the case where two types of sensors are deployed: the first consists of expensive, high quality sensors; and the second, of cheap low quality sensors, which are activated only if the intensity of the spatial field exceeds a pre-defined activation threshold (eg. wind sensors). In addition, these sensors are powered by means of energy harvesting and their time varying energy status impacts on the accuracy of the measurement that may be obtained. We account for this phenomenon by encoding the energy harvesting process into the second moment properties of the additive noise, resulting in a spatial heteroscedastic process. We then address the following two important problems: (i) how to efficiently perform spatial field reconstruction based on measurements obtained simultaneously from both networks; and (ii) how to perform query based sensor set selection with predictive MSE performance guarantee. We first show that the resulting predictive posterior distribution, which is key in fusing such disparate observations, involves solving intractable integrals. To overcome this problem, we solve the first problem by developing a low complexity algorithm based on the spatial best linear unbiased estimator (S-BLUE). Next, building on the S-BLUE, we address the second problem, and develop an efficient algorithm for query based sensor set selection with performance guarantee. Our algorithm is based on the Cross Entropy method which solves the combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient manner.

"arXiv:1801.09135","Nishant Deepak Keni, Amol Mangirish Singbal, Rizwan Ahmed","eess.IV","Sparse representation using over-complete dictionaries have shown to produce good quality results in various image processing tasks. Dictionary learning algorithms have made it possible to engineer data adaptive dictionaries which have promising applications in image compression and image enhancement. The most common sparse dictionary learning algorithms use the techniques of matching pursuit and K-SVD iteratively for sparse coding and dictionary learning respectively. While this technique produces good results, it requires a large number of iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In this article, we use a closed form stabilized convex optimization technique for both sparse coding and dictionary learning. The approach results in providing the best possible dictionary and the sparsest representation resulting in minimum reconstruction error. Once the image is reconstructed from the compressively sensed samples, we use adaptive frequency and spatial filtering techniques to move towards exact image recovery. It is clearly seen from the results that the proposed algorithm provides much better reconstruction results than conventional sparse dictionary techniques for a fixed number of iterations. Depending inversely upon the number of details present in the image, the proposed algorithm reaches the optimal solution with a significantly lower number of iterations. Consequently, high PSNR and low MSE is obtained using the proposed algorithm for our compressive sensing framework."

Montoya, Yinsheng Li, Charles Strother, Guang-Hong Chen","eess.IV","Background and Purpose: Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography (DLA) method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced acquisition.  Material and Methods: Under an approved IRB protocol 105 3D-DSA exams were randomly selected from an internal database. All were acquired using a clinical system (Axiom Artis zee, Siemens Healthineers) in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into three tissue types (vasculature, bone and soft tissue). The trained DLA model was then applied for tissue classification in a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort consisting of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D-DLA images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F1-scores were calculated for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D-DLA and clinical 3D-DSA images were subject to a qualitative assessment for the presence of inter-sweep motion artifacts.  Results: Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset was 98.7% ([98.3, 99.1] %). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for all 3D-DLA testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared to 37% (23/62) of the 3D-DSAs.  Conclusion: DLA accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D-DSA reconstructions without mask. DLA reduced mis-registration artifacts induced by inter-sweep motion. DLA reduces radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D-DSA"

In this paper, we propose WiBall, an accurate and calibration-free indoor tracking system that can work well in non-line-of-sight based on radio signals. WiBall leverages a stationary and location-independent property of the time-reversal focusing effect of radio signals for highly accurate moving distance estimation. Together with the direction estimation based on inertial measurement unit and location correction using the constraints from the floorplan, WiBall is shown to be able to track a moving object with decimeter-level accuracy in different environments. Since WiBall can accommodate a large number of users with only a single pair of devices, it is low-cost and easily scalable, and can be a promising candidate for future indoor tracking applications."

In this paper, we present WiSpeed, a universal low-complexity indoor speed estimation system leveraging radio signals, such as commercial WiFi, LTE, 5G, etc., which can work in both device-free and device-based situations. By exploiting the statistical theory of electromagnetic waves, we establish a link between the autocorrelation function of the physical layer channel state information and the speed of a moving object, which lays the foundation of WiSpeed. WiSpeed differs from the other schemes requiring strong line-of-sight conditions between the source and observer in that it embraces the rich-scattering environment typical for indoors to facilitate highly accurate speed estimation. Moreover, as a calibration-free system, WiSpeed saves the users' efforts from large-scale training and fine-tuning of system parameters. In addition, WiSpeed could extract the stride length as well as detect abnormal activities such as falling down, a major threat to seniors that leads to a large number of fatalities every year. Extensive experiments show that WiSpeed achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 4.85% for device-free human walking speed estimation and 4.62% for device-based speed estimation, and a detection rate of 95% without false alarms for fall detection."

"arXiv:1712.01722","Yu Zhang, Xiao-Yang Liu","eess.SP","The localization technology is important for the development of indoor location-based services (LBS). The radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based localization is one of the most promising approaches. However, it is challenging to apply this localization to real-world environments since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to construct a fingerprint database as a prior for localization. Another challenge is that the presence of anomaly readings in the fingerprints reduces the localization accuracy. To address these two challenges, we propose an efficient and robust indoor localization approach. First, we model the fingerprint database as a 3-D tensor, which represents the relationships between fingerprints, locations and indices of access points. Second, we introduce a tensor decomposition model for robust fingerprint data recovery, which decomposes a partial observation tensor as the superposition of a low-rank tensor and a spare anomaly tensor. Third, we exploit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the convex optimization problem of tensor-nuclear-norm completion for the anomaly case. Finally, we verify the proposed approach on a ground truth data set collected in an office building with size 80m times 20m. Experiment results show that to achieve a same error rate 4%, the sampling rate of our approach is only 10%, while it is 60% for the state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, the proposed approach leads to a more accurate localization (nearly 20%, 0.6m improvement) over the compared approach."

Because of the tonotopic organization of the cochlea, high frequency emissions should return earlier than low frequencies; however, due to the random nature of coherent reflection, the frequency-latency relation is monotonic only when averaged across many ears. For individual ears, the instantaneous frequency (IF) and amplitude envelope of TEOAEs both fluctuate and are difficult to analyze via linear transformations. In this paper, we propose to analyze TEOAE signals by a nonlinear, synchrosqueezing-based technique called concentration of frequency and time (ConceFT). In our simulation, the present method is able to capture the IF function at near 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Validity of the present method is discussed in the context of coherent reflection based on its formulation in both the time-frequency and the space-wavenumber domains."

In particular, under the goal of minimizing the airborne service time needed for communicating with ground users, a novel framework for deploying and operating a drone-based antenna array system whose elements are single-antenna drones is proposed. In the considered model, the service time is minimized by jointly optimizing the wireless transmission time as well as the control time that is needed for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the transmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the drone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques, the drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive, perturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the drones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time for the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones, the drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so as to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor drones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the destinations of the drones and external forces (e.g., wind and gravity). In particular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well as the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground users compared to a multi-drone scenario in which the same number of drones are deployed separately to serve ground users. The results also show that, in comparison with the multi-drones case, the network's spectral efficiency can be significantly improved."

In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity interference-free filter bank multicarrier system with QAM modulation (FBMC/QAM) using filter deconvolution. The proposed method is based on inversion of the prototype filters which completely removes the intrinsic interference at the receiver and allows the use of complex-valued signaling. The interference terms in FBMC/QAM with and without the proposed system are analyzed and compared in terms of mean square error (MSE). It is shown with theoretical and simulation results that the proposed method cancels the intrinsic interference and improves the output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the expense of slight enhancement of residual interferences caused by multipath channel. The complexity of the proposed system is also analyzed along with performance evaluation in an asynchronous multiservice scenario. It is shown that the proposed FBMC/QAM system with filter deconvolution outperforms the conventional OFDM system."

This paper proposes two different strategies for designing autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters on both directed and undirected graphs. The first approach is inspired by Prony's method, which considers a modified error between the modeled and the desired frequency response. The second technique is based on an iterative approach, which finds the filter coefficients by iteratively minimizing the true error (instead of the modified error) between the modeled and the desired frequency response. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with finite impulse response (FIR) graph filters, on both synthetic and real data. The obtained results show that ARMA filters outperform FIR filters in terms of approximation accuracy and they are suitable for graph signal interpolation, compression and prediction."
"arXiv:1711.09301","Stephen Kruzick, José M. F.

Suitably designed filters applied to the state values can significantly improve the convergence rate. For constant networks, these filters can be viewed in terms of graph signal processing as polynomials in a single matrix, the consensus iteration matrix, with filter response evaluated at its eigenvalues. For random, time-varying networks, filter design becomes more complicated, involving eigendecompositions of sums and products of random, time-varying iteration matrices. This paper focuses on deriving an estimate for the Gram matrix of error in the state vectors over a filtering window for large-scale, stationary, switching random networks. The result depends on the moments of the empirical spectral distribution, which can be estimated through Monte-Carlo simulation. This work then defines a quadratic objective function to minimize the expected consensus estimate error norm. Simulation results provide support for the approximation."

Uniform and non-uniform quantizers are employed in our simulation.  Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that our approximate formula gives a tight upper bound for the BER performance of $b$-bit resolution quantized systems using non-uniform quantizers, whereas the use of uniform quantizers cause a lower performance for the same systems. We also found a small BER performance degradation in coarse quantized systems, for example 2-3 bits QPSK and 3-4 bits 16-QAM, compared to the full-precision (unquantized) case.

However, the clinimetric accuracy achievable with such technology is highly reliant on separating the useful from irrelevant or confounded sensor data. Monitoring patient symptoms using digital sensors outside of controlled, clinical lab settings creates a variety of practical challenges, such as unavoidable and unexpected user behaviours. These behaviours often violate the assumptions of clinimetric testing protocols, where these protocols are designed to probe for specific symptoms. Such violations are frequent outside the lab, and can affect the accuracy of the subsequent data analysis and scientific conclusions. At the same time, curating sensor data by hand after the collection process is inherently subjective, laborious and error-prone. To address these problems, we report on a unified algorithmic framework for automated sensor data quality control, which can identify those parts of the sensor data which are sufficiently reliable for further analysis. Algorithms which are special cases of this framework for different sensor data types (e.g. accelerometer, digital audio) detect the extent to which the sensor data adheres to the assumptions of the test protocol for a variety of clinimetric tests. The approach is general enough to be applied to a large set of clinimetric tests and we demonstrate its performance on walking, balance and voice smartphone-based tests, designed to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson's disease."

"arXiv:1710.03538","Mirco Ravanelli, Maurizio Omologo","eess.AS","Despite the significant progress made in the last years, state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies provide a satisfactory performance only in the close-talking condition. Robustness of distant speech recognition in adverse acoustic conditions, on the other hand, remains a crucial open issue for future applications of human-machine interaction. To this end, several advances in speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis as well as acoustic modeling, have recently contributed to improve the state-of-the-art in the field. One of the most effective approaches to derive a robust acoustic modeling is based on using contaminated speech, which proved helpful in reducing the acoustic mismatch between training and testing conditions.  In this paper, we revise this classical approach in the context of modern DNN-HMM systems, and propose the adoption of three methods, namely, asymmetric context windowing, close-talk based supervision, and close-talk based pre-training. The experimental results, obtained using both real and simulated data, show a significant advantage in using these three methods, overall providing a 15% error rate reduction compared to the baseline systems. The same trend in performance is confirmed either using a high-quality training set of small size, and a large one."

Since access to such prior knowledge is limited or not possible in practice, one has to estimate the clean signal statistics. In this paper, we develop a new risk minimization framework for speech enhancement, in which, one optimizes an unbiased estimate of the distortion/risk instead of the actual risk. The estimated risk is expressed solely as a function of the noisy observations. We consider several perceptually relevant distortion measures and develop corresponding unbiased estimates under realistic assumptions on the noise distribution and a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Minimizing the risk estimates gives rise to the corresponding denoisers, which are nonlinear functions of the a posteriori SNR. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), average segmental SNR (SSNR) computations, and listening tests show that the proposed risk optimization approach employing Itakura-Saito and weighted hyperbolic cosine distortions gives better performance than the other distortion measures. For SNRs greater than 5 dB, the proposed approach gives superior denoising performance over the benchmark techniques based on the Wiener filter, log-MMSE minimization, and Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization."

However, the susceptibility of mmWave signals to severe pathloss and shadowing requires the use of highly directional antennas to overcome such adverse characteristics. Building a network with directional beams changes the interference behavior, since, narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages. Such sensitivity to blockages causes uncertainty in the active interfering node locations. Configuration uncertainty may also manifest in the spectral domain while applying dynamic channel and frequency assignment to support 5G applications. In this paper, we first propose a blockage model considering mmWave specifications. Subsequently, using the proposed blockage model, we derive a spatial-spectral interference model for dense finite-area 5G mmWave networks. The proposed interference model considers both spatial and spectral randomness in node configuration. Finally, the error performance of the network from an arbitrarily located user perspective is calculated in terms of bit error rate (BER) and outage probability metrics. The analytical results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that considering mmWave specifications and also randomness in both spectral and spatial node configurations leads to a noticeably different interference profile."

To overcome the sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, we propose a new phased-array based sub-Nyquist sampling architecture with variable time delays, where a uniform linear array (ULA) is employed and the received signal at each antenna is delayed by a variable amount of time and then sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-digital converter (ADC).

Perfect recovery conditions for the associated parameters and the power spectrum are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that our proposed method does not require to place any sparse constraint on the wideband spectrum, only needs the sampling rate to be greater than the bandwidth of the narrowband source signal with the largest bandwidth among all sources.

For very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) image stacks - frequently required for undistorted imaging at liquid nitrogen temperatures - image registration is particularly delicate, and standard approaches may either fail, or produce subtly specious reconstructed lattice images. We present an approach which effectively registers and averages image stacks which are challenging due to their low-SNR and propensity for unit cell misalignments. Registering all possible image pairs in a multi-image stack leads to significant information surplus. In combination with a simple physical picture of stage drift, this enables identification of incorrect image registrations, and determination of the optimal image shifts from the complete set of relative shifts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on experimental, cryogenic STEM datasets, highlighting subtle artifacts endemic to low-SNR lattice images and how they can be avoided. High-SNR average images with information transfer out to 0.72 A are achieved at 300 kV and with the sample cooled to near liquid nitrogen temperature."

Nix","eess.SP","5G systems aim to achieve extremely high data rates, low end-to-end latency and ultra-low power consumption. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the design of 5G physical layer waveforms. One important candidate is Generalised Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). In order to evaluate its performance and features, system-level studies should be undertaken in a range of scenarios. These studies, however, require highly complex computations if they are performed using bit-level simulators. In this paper, the Mutual Information (MI) based link quality model (PHY abstraction), which has been regularly used to implement system-level studies for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is applied to GFDM. The performance of the GFDM waveform using this model and the bit-level simulation performance is measured using different channel types. Moreover, a system-level study for a GFDM based LTE-A system in a realistic scenario, using both a bit-level simulator and this abstraction model, has been studied and compared. The results reveal the accuracy of this model using realistic channel data. Based on these results, the PHY abstraction technique can be applied to evaluate the performance of GFDM based systems in an effective manner with low complexity. The maximum difference in the Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput results in the abstraction case compared to bit-level simulation does not exceed 4% whilst offering a simulation time saving reduction of around 62,000 times."

Ahmadi, Nahal Maleki, Azadeh Vosoughi","eess.SP","We consider a binary hypothesis testing problem in an inhomogeneous wireless sensor network, where a fusion center (FC) makes a global decision on the underlying hypothesis. We assume sensors observations are correlated Gaussian and sensors are unaware of this correlation when making decisions. Sensors send their modulated decisions over fading channels, subject to individual and/or total transmit power constraints. For parallel-access channel (PAC) and multiple-access channel (MAC) models, we derive modified deflection coefficient (MDC) of the test statistic at the FC with coherent reception.We propose a transmit power allocation scheme, which maximizes MDC of the test statistic, under three different sets of transmit power constraints: total power constraint, individual and total power constraints, individual power constraints only. When analytical solutions to our constrained optimization problems are elusive, we discuss how these problems can be converted to convex ones. We study how correlation among sensors observations, reliability of local decisions, communication channel model and channel qualities and transmit power constraints affect the reliability of the global decision and power allocation of inhomogeneous sensors."

Traditional load management methods usually require a centralized powerful control center and a two-way communication network between the system operators and energy end-users. The increasing user participation in smart grids may limit their applications. In this paper, a distributed solution for load management in emerging smart grids is proposed. The load management problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem aiming at maximizing the overall utility of users while meeting the requirement for load reduction requested by the system operator, and is solved by using a distributed dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm is implemented via a distributed framework and thus can deliver a highly desired distributed solution. It avoids the required use of a centralized coordinator or control center, and can achieve satisfactory outcomes for load management. Simulation results with various test systems demonstrate its effectiveness."
"arXiv:1710.08744","Tolga Ergen, Suleyman Serdar Kozat","eess.SP","In this brief paper, we investigate online training of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures in a distributed network of nodes, where each node employs an LSTM based structure for online regression. In particular, each node sequentially receives a variable length data sequence with its label and can only exchange information with its neighbors to train the LSTM architecture. We first provide a generic LSTM based regression structure for each node. In order to train this structure, we put the LSTM equations in a nonlinear state space form for each node and then introduce a highly effective and efficient Distributed Particle Filtering (DPF) based training algorithm. We also introduce a Distributed Extended Kalman Filtering (DEKF) based training algorithm for comparison. Here, our DPF based training algorithm guarantees convergence to the performance of the optimal LSTM coefficients in the mean square error (MSE) sense under certain conditions. We achieve this performance with communication and computational complexity in the order of the first order gradient based methods. Through both simulated and real life examples, we illustrate significant performance improvements with respect to the state of the art methods."

It serves as a good candidate for the future communication network with massive nodes due to its capability of handling user overloading. Introducing SCMA to visible light communication (VLC) can provide another opportunity on design of transmission protocols for the communication network with massive nodes due to the limited communication range of VLC, which reduces the interference intensity. However, when applying SCMA in VLC systems, we need to modify the SCMA codebook to accommodate the real and positive signal requirement for VLC.We apply multidimensional constellation design methods to SCMA codebook. To reduce the design complexity, we also propose a symmetric codebook design. For all the proposed design approaches, the minimum Euclidean distance aims to be maximized. Our symmetric codebook design can reduce design and detection complexity simultaneously. Simulation results show that our design implies fast convergence with respect to the number of iterations, and outperforms the design that simply modifies the existing approaches to VLC signal requirements."

When monitoring spatial phenomena under a fixed budget, i.e., either physical, economical or computational constraints, the selection of a subset of available sensors, referred to as sparse sensing, that meets both the budget and performance requirements is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the subset selection problem for detection under dependent observations is combinatorial in nature and suboptimal subset selection algorithms must be employed. In this work, different from the widely used convex relaxation of the problem, we leverage submodularity, the diminishing returns property, to provide practical near optimal algorithms suitable for large-scale subset selection. This is achieved by means of low-complexity greedy algorithms, which incur a reduced computational complexity compared to their convex counterparts."
"arXiv:1710.09786","Mostafa Medra, Yongwei Huang, Timothy N. Davidson","eess.SP","The design of a set of beamformers for the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink that provides the receivers with prespecified levels of quality-of-service (QoS) can be quite challenging when the channel state information is not perfectly known at the base station. The constraint of having the SINR meet or exceed a given threshold with high probability is intractable in general, which results in problems that are fundamentally hard to solve. In this paper, we will develop a high quality approximation of the SINR outage constraint that, along with a semidefinite relaxation, enables us to formulate the beamformer design problem as a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. For systems in which the uncertainty size is small, a further approximation yields algorithms based on iterative evaluations of closed-form expressions that have substantially lower computational cost. Since finding the beamforming directions incurs most of the computational load of these algorithms, analogous power loading algorithms for predefined beamforming directions are developed and their performance is shown to be close to optimal. When the system contains a large number of antennas, the proposed power loading can be obtained at a computational cost that grows only linearly in the number of antennas. The proposed power loading algorithm provides an explicit relationship between the outage probability required and the power consumed, which allows us to precisely control the power consumption, and automatically identifies users who are consuming most of the power resources. The flexibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by developing a power loading technique that minimizes an average notion of outage."

Further, we exploit deep neural networks as a general purpose tool to implement our model and propose a training scheme for which, even while training with the binary frame error events (i.e., ACKs / NACKs), the network outputs converge to the FEP conditioned on the input channel state. We provide simulation results that demonstrate gains in the FEP prediction accuracy with our approach as compared to the traditional effective exponential SIR metric (EESM) approach for a range of channel code rates, and show that these gains can be exploited to increase the link throughput."

"arXiv:1709.08182","Aidana Irmanova, Olga Krestinskaya, Alex Pappachen James","eess.IV","In this paper, we present on-sensor neuromorphic vision hardware implementation of denoising spatial filter. The mean or median spatial filters with fixed window shape are known for its denoising ability, however, have the drawback of blurring the object edges. The effect of blurring increases with an increase in window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an adaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and calculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are converted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied as neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater level than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as similar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the serial-in-parallel-out shift register. The outputs of shift registers are used as input to the selector switches of an averaging circuit making this an adaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter. System level simulation of the hardware is conducted using 150 images from Caltech database with added Gaussian noise to test the robustness of edge-preserving and denoising ability of the proposed filter. Threshold values of the hardware neuron were adjusted so that the proposed edge-preserving spatial filter achieves optimal performance in terms of PSNR and MSE, and these results outperforms that of the conventional mean and median filters."

Nevertheless, a perfect match between the true and the assumed data models cannot be achieved in many practical applications. In all these cases, it is advisable to use a robust decision test, i.e. a test whose statistic preserves (at least asymptotically) the same probability density function (pdf) for a suitable set of possible input data models under the null hypothesis. Building upon the seminal work of Kent (1982), in this paper we investigate the impact of the model mismatch in a recurring HT problem in radar signal processing applications: testing the mean of a set of Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) distributed random vectors under a possible misspecified, Gaussian data model. In particular, by using this general misspecified framework, a new look to two popular detectors, the Kelly's Generalized Likelihood Ration Test (GLRT) and the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF), is provided and their robustness properties investigated."

In this paper we propose to reduce the required signal acquisition time by using a novel sampling scheme based on a random selection of Morlet wavelets convolved with white noise. While such functions exhibit random properties, they are locally determined by Morlet wavelet parameters. The proposed method is equivalent to random sampling of the properly selected part of the feature space, which maps the measured images accurately both in the spatial and spatial frequency domains. We compare both numerically and experimentally the image quality obtained with our sampling protocol against widely-used sampling with Walsh-Hadamard or noiselet functions. The results show considerable improvement over the former methods, enabling single-pixel imaging at low compression rates on the order of a few percent."

A CAES plant consists of compressors, expanders, caverns, and a motor/generator set. Currently used cavern models for CAES are either accurate but highly non-linear or linear but inaccurate. Highly non-linear cavern models cannot be directly utilized in power system optimization problems. In this regard, an accurate bi-linear cavern model for CAES is proposed in this first paper of a two-part series. The charging and discharging processes in a cavern are divided into several virtual states and then the first law of thermodynamics and ideal gas law are used to derive a cavern model, i.e., model for the variation of temperature and pressure in these processes. Thereafter, the heat transfer between the air in the cavern and the cavern wall is considered and integrated into the cavern model. By subsequently eliminating several negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to a bi-linear (linear) model for CAES with multiple (single) time steps. The accuracy of the proposed cavern model is verified via comparison with an accurate non-linear model."

The proposed technique is based on creating an opposite-phase baseband equivalent replica of the TX leakage signal in the transceiver digital front-end through adaptive nonlinear filtering of the known transmit data, to facilitate highly accurate cancellation under a nonlinear TX power amplifier (PA). The active RF cancellation is then accomplished by employing an auxiliary transmitter chain, to generate the actual RF cancellation signal, and combining it with the received signal at the receiver (RX) low noise amplifier (LNA) input. A closed-loop parameter learning approach, based on the decorrelation principle, is also developed to efficiently estimate the coefficients of the nonlinear cancellation filter in the presence of a nonlinear TX PA with memory, finite passive isolation, and a nonlinear RX LNA. The performance of the proposed cancellation technique is evaluated through comprehensive RF measurements adopting commercial LTE-Advanced transceiver hardware components. The results show that the proposed technique can provide an additional suppression of up to 54 dB for the TX passband leakage signal at the RX LNA input, even at considerably high transmit power levels and with wide transmission bandwidths. Such novel cancellation solution can therefore substantially improve the TX-RX isolation, hence reducing the requirements on passive isolation and RF component linearity, as well as increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the RF spectrum use in the emerging 5G radio networks."
